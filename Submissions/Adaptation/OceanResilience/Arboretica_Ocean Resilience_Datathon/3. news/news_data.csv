It is estimated 75% of all Antarctic krill is to be found in the Peninsula region

The Antarctica Peninsula where to the west Chile and Argentina are hoping to establish an MPS

Argentine and Chilean relations have not been traditionally smooth given the several borderline disputes both in land and in the sea, but there is a chance that this rivalry turns into a biodiversity milestone, with the joint proposal to create a Marine Protected Area in waters next to west Antarctica Peninsula and south of the Scotia arc, a project in which the Chilean Antarctic Institute and Argentina's Antarctic Institute have been working on since 2012.

In 2017 the project was preliminarily presented before CCAMLR. Commission for the Conservation of Antarctica Marine Living Resources, which since 2002 is trying to develop a system of MPA's in Antarctica with the purpose of conserving biodiversity and the rational and responsible exploitation of resources in the area.

This is critical since many scientific research papers indicate that the Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing an increase in environment variability because of global climate warming. This has resulted in a thinning of the continent's cap, calving icebergs and instability.

The proposal was allegedly admitted, meaning the technical description of the proposal but the tallest wall is the political consensus in CCAMLR. In the framework of the Oceans Conference recently held in Lisbon, the two heads of the Antarctic Institutes, Juan Cabandié from Argentina and Maisa Rojas Corradi, from Chile met to assess the MPA in Antarctica was, and establish a road map.

The Antarctica MPA covers a total area of 670,000 sq kilometers in two zones, General Protection (blue in the map), with no fishing allowed particularly for krill and the Fishery zone (orange in the map) where krill can be netted, according to country quotas.

According to the Argentine Inter-governmental Group of Experts on Climate Change, global warming makes the polar ice cap far more unstable, which could have catastrophic consequences for coastal zones of the planet at sea level and impact of the global water mass. Likewise with cruise tourism and thinner ice, vessels approach deeper interfering with krill, and the food chain. And krill is crucial in carbon absorption and in the biodiversity current which circumvents the pole. Besides 75% of all Antarctic krill is to be found in the Peninsula region.

The interesting factor is that to the Argentine and Chilean MPA initiative, which is in itself a milestone, must be added to the other two Antarctica MPAs, supported by Europe. in Eastern Antarctica and the Weddell Sea. Together the three cover an area equivalent to continental Europe, according to members from the Argentine foreign ministry Technical desk.

However since CCAMLR decisions have to be unanimous, the initiative remains blocked by China and Russia. China because of its huge fishing fleet and the need to feed its people, while Russia's attitude responds to the current conflict with the West over the Ukraine invasion.

Argentina is also advancing in the creation of a benthonic MPA. Apparently a high productivity area on the continental shelf, and one of five priority areas chosen for the Blue Pampa project.

The new MPA has some 148,000 sq kilometers and is geared to protect marine assets, conservation of fishery resources and even a standing homage to the crew of the sunken submarine ARA San Juan, in the area.

The new MPA was approved last month in the Argentine Lower House and now faces the Senate vote. It is an area rich in phytoplankton production, the first link of the food chain, and neighboring Argentine EEZ borderline, which registers an intense foreign fleets fishing activities.",en,"China, Ukraine, Lisbon, Chile, Argentina, Russia","the Chilean Antarctic Institute, Commission for the Conservation of Antarctica Marine Living Resources, Inter-governmental Group of Experts on Climate Change, the Antarctic Institutes, CCAMLR, Antarctic Institute, Lower House, Senate","Maisa Corradi, Juan Cabandié","antarctica, area, peninsula, mpa, argentina, antarctic, krill, argentine, marine, chile"

The prize will allow Jason to upgrade his equipment and continue to grow the reach of DroneShark. Jason’s work has been instrumental in changing perceptions about sharks in Sydney waters and creates intrigue and wonder with human and marine interaction. He also contributes data to scientists such as Vanessa Pirrotti, and shares information with the local life guards. He plans to develop the DroneShark platforms in order to connect with young people in different ways.

‘Together with my 800, 000 followers we’ve watched Great White Sharks enter Bondi waters; watched whales and dolphins swim with people, bait balls morph into heart shapes. We’ve seen random creatures such as a leatherback turtle, Sunny the sunfish and a leopard shark cruise by, and when we are lucky, all the gang on the screen together co-existing and dancing in the ocean.‘ Jason Iggleden

City East Prize awarded to Miriam Lieberman for Love Letters to the Ocean.

Miriam is an award-winning musician who is developing an ocean literacy project that aims to foster a sense of personal connection, love, wonder and protection of the ocean in young children. This project will include workshops in selected local early childhood education centres and primary schools and will culminate in a Performance and Display at The Volvo Ocean Lovers Festival in March 2023.

‘FISH FARM MAPS DENIED’

BY ROSEMARY MURPHY



Claims of salmon expansion bid in ‘no-grow’ zones author Richard Flanagan and the Tasmanian Alliance for Marine Protection claim to have revealed undisclosed maps that show a potential expansion for the aquaculture sector, including potentially into areas currently designated “no-grow” zones. However, an industry representative says there is no “grand conspiracy” and there are no plans to expand into such areas.

TAMP co-chair Peter George said the maps outlined two scenarios, one for current suitability and the other for future development as technologies evolve. He said the maps showed the areas deemed suitable for the industry included the entire north coast east of King Island , all the seas surrounding the Furneaux Islands and the east coast from Cape Portland to Storm Bay and Southeast Cape. “Even some areas of the rugged west coast are designated as suitable for future technology,” he said. Mr George said the maps were compiled by the government and industry representatives in response to the claims the government’s original “grow” and “no-grow ” zones were drawn up without consultation with Tassal, Huon Aquaculture or Petuna.

Tasmanian Salmonid Growers Association spokesman Julian Amos said the government was in the process of working on a new map. “The government has been looking at spatial mapping and spatial planning, but that does not mean it will be subject to further expansion,” he said. “I have no knowledge whatsoever of any company wanting to expand further than what’s already out there.” He said any future expansions would be subject to proper assessments of the area. “There’s no secrecy on the part of industry, no secrecy on the part of government. People are talking about it like it’s a grand conspiracy but that’s not the case,” Mr Amos said.

A government spokeswoman said government was supportive of the industry. “Any future growth in Tasmania’s salmon industry will be subject to robust statutory planning and environmental approval processes and suggestions from anti-salmon activists of unfettered expansion are simply false.”

Mr Flanagan first spoke of the existence of the maps at the first of two public meeting in the state’s North-West at the weekend organised by the group NWTas for Clean Oceans, with about 200 people attending both. The group is calling for a moratorium on the expansion of ocean-based salmon farming and stricter regulation and wants to see a transition to land-based salmon farming.",en,Tasmania,"the Tasmanian Alliance for Marine Protection, Tassal, Petuna, Tasmanian Salmonid Growers Association, Tasmanian Alliance for Marine Protection, the Mercury Newspaper, Huon Aquaculture, NWTas for Clean Oceans, TAMP","Rosemary Murphy, Julian Amos, Peter George, Richard Flanagan","government, maps, industry, salmon, expansion, grow, areas, future, tasmanian, zones"
8,2022-09-30,About the Industry — Tasmanian Alliance for Marine Protection,https://www.tamp.org.au/industry,0,0,0,0,tamp.org.au,Australia,"In 2018, the salmon industry produced 50,000 tonnes p/a from 14 marine farm plans around the state, according to the Tasmanian Government’s Salmon Growth Plan (Big Salmon Plan).

LEARNING FROM THE MACQUARIE HARBOUR DISASTER

Over 1,350,000 Salmon died in Macquarie Harbour due to Government’s broken regulatory and compliance system. The stocking limit in Macquarie Harbour peaked at 26,500 tonnes in 2016. The stocking density should never have been allowed to grow so high. It is now back to the 2015 level of 9,500 tonnes. This stocking density reflects the biomass that can survive in the harbour (rather than any concern for rehabilitation) and that areas under the pens resemble an underwater industrial wasteland, devoid of aquatic life. This kind of management of a public waterway represents world’s worst practise and Tasmanians are rightly concerned that the industry and government are incompetent, lack transparency, and cannot be trusted to ensure that other pristine waterways around Tasmania will not be destroyed in the same way.

Proposed Expansion - Storm Bay

Tasmania’s Salmon Producers are preparing for an expansion into Storm Bay that will double the size of the industry. The initial expansion is for 30,000-40,000 tonnes per annum with an aspirational target of 80,000 tpa. This represents a 1,300% increase in the amount of salmon produced and associated pollution. This rapid upscaling suggests neither the government nor industry has learnt from its mistakes in Macquarie Harbour.

The government’s controls on pollution are among the worst in the world. The industry regularly breaks its lease conditions, but the government and regulator do nothing aside from lowering the thresholds which define non-compliance.

The industry expansion will create a concentrated nutrient input (dissolved and solid nitrogen pollution) in Storm Bay. Elevated nitrogen levels cause algal blooms and re-suspend heavy metals trapped in bottom sediments. The Derwent has some of the highest sedimentary heavy metal concentrations in the world.

All oceanic water passes through Storm Bay into the Derwent Estuary, Frederick Henry and Norfolk Bay. These bays are prime recreational fishing and boating areas and host most of Greater Hobart and the Southern beaches. The D’Entrecasteaux is already experiencing elevated nitrogen levels due to the presence of large nutrient input from fish farms. The urine and faecal pollution from the salmon will be around 2,296 tpa (initial expansion),then 4,592 tpa mainly in the form of dissolved nitrogen (approximately 85% of the total output is released as a solution into the water column).

Wir Landlebewesen vergessen gerne darauf, wie wichtig die Ozeane für unseren Planeten sind. Nach wie vor sind große Teile der Meere wissenschaftlich unerschlossen, die Tiefsee ist weniger erforscht als die Mondoberfläche. Dabei spielten einst die Ozeane nicht nur eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Entstehung von Leben auf der Erde, sie bilden bis heute den größten Lebensraum mit einer schier unüberblickbaren Artenvielfalt. Dieser biologische Reichtum zählt auch zu den wichtigsten Lebensgrundlagen des Menschen. Noch unverzichtbarer ist die Rolle der Meere im Klimasystem.

Die Ozeankonferenz der Vereinten Nationen (UNOC), die von Montag, 27. Juni bis 1. Juli in Lissabon stattfand, endet heute mit der Verabschiedung einer hochrangigen politischen Erklärung.



Es herrscht Einigkeit über den kritischen Zustand, in dem sich die Meere befinden und dass die Staaten bei der derzeitigen Entwicklung und ""business as usual"" auf dem besten Weg sind, das UNO Ziel 14 für nachhaltige Entwicklung (SDG14) zu verfehlen. Die Atmosphäre schwankte zwischen Dringlichkeit und Hoffnung.



Die UNOC-Erklärung mit dem Titel ""Unsere Ozeane, unsere Zukunft, unsere Verantwortung"" erkennt die negativen Auswirkungen des Klimawandels, der Überfischung, der Plastikverschmutzung und des Lärms auf die Weltmeere an. Dieser Appell soll auch als Fahrplan für die Verwirklichung des SDG 14 zur Rettung der Ozeane dienen.



""Die Meere sind in einem kritischen Zustand. Jetzt muss die gesamte Weltgemeinschaft konkrete Lösungen finden, um die Ozeane wieder auf die Tagesordnung zu setzen. Entscheidend ist, dass diesen Verpflichtungen auch Taten folgen, einschließlich verbindlicher Maßnahmen, sagt Fabienne McLellan, Geschäftsführerin der internationalen Meeresschutzorganisation OceanCare.



OceanCare zieht folgende Bilanz:



Unterwasser-Lärmverschmutzung:



- Die rechtliche Analyse des internationalen Seerechts zeigt: eine verbindliche Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung in ausschließlichen Wirtschaftszonen ist mit dem Prinzip der Freiheit der Schifffahrt vereinbar.



- Maßnahmen zur Verringerung der Schiffsgeschwindigkeit sollten verpflichtend sein, um allen Schifffahrtsunternehmen die gleichen Wettbewerbsbedingungen zu geben.



- Die Verringerung des Schiffstempos ist die kosteneffizienteste betriebliche Maßnahme, um die Lärmbelästigung deutlich zu reduzieren. Sie ist einfach und sofort umsetzbar. Zudem verringert sie Treibhausgase und Luftschadstoffe, wie auch des Risikos von Kollisionen mit Meeressäugern.



""Die Schifffahrtsindustrie sollte ihrer Verpflichtung nachkommen, den ökologischen Fußabdruck deutlich zu reduzieren, um die Nachhaltigkeitsziele zu erreichen. OceanCare ist von der Notwendigkeit überzeugt, diese verbindlichen Maßnahmen zur Geschwindigkeitsreduzierung gesetzlich zu verankern und durchzusetzen. Erfahrungsgemäß funktionieren freiwillige Maßnahmen nicht. Wir brauchen Gesetze, um dieses Problem zu lösen"", erklärt Carlos Bravo, Ocean Policy Expert bei OceanCare.



""Im Vergleich zu anderen Themen der Meeresverschmutzung war die Diskussion über Meereslärm in den interaktiven Dialogen bei der UNOC auf eine Handvoll Erwähnungen begrenzt. Dies ist umso bedauerlicher, da es sich um eine der wenigen Formen der Verschmutzung handelt, deren Auswirkungen sofort gestoppt werden können"", sagt Nadia Deckert, OceanCare-Expertin für Meerespolitik.



Plastikverschmutzung:



- Viele Regierungen siedeln das Problem der Plastikverschmutzung der Meere prioritär an. Diskussionen über diese allgegenwärtige Bedrohung dominierten viele Nebenveranstaltungen und Konferenzdialoge.



- Die Notwendigkeit eines Übergangs von einer linearen zu einer stärker kreislauforientierten Wirtschaft wurde allgemein anerkannt. OceanCare mahnt sicherzustellen, dass eine solche Kreislaufwirtschaft sicher vor gefährlichen Chemikalien ist.



- Ein globales Plastikabkommen, dessen Verhandlung noch in diesem Jahr beginnen wird, fand breite Unterstützung.



""Die Herausforderung besteht darin, ein rechtsverbindlich Plastik-Abkommen zu verabschieden, das den gesamten Lebenszyklus von Kunststoffen abdeckt: von der Gewinnung fossiler Brennstoffe als Ausgangsmaterial für Plastik bis hin zur Abfallentsorgung. Erforderlich sind klare Ziele für die Reduzierung der Kunststoffproduktion, die Durchsetzung des Verursacherprinzips und die Einrichtung eines speziellen Fonds, um die Umsetzung sicherzustellen"", so McLellan.



Tiefsee-Bergbau:



OceanCare begrüsst die Gründung einer Länderallianz gegen Tiefseebergbau durch Samoa, Palau und Fidschi und hofft, dass diese Allianz rasch wächst. Tuvalu und Guam bekundeten bereits ihre Unterstützung für die Allianz. Auch Chile hatte zuvor ein 15-jähriges Moratorium für den Tiefseebergbau gefordert, und ähnliche Stimmen wurden von den Föderierten Staaten von Mikronesien und Papua-Neuguinea laut.



Auch der französische Präsident Emmanuel Macron sprach sich während der Konferenz entschieden gegen den Tiefseebergbau auf hoher See aus. Ein solcher Schritt eines EU-Mitgliedsstaates wurde von Naturschützern lange erwartet, er steht im Einklang mit der bereits von der Europäischen Kommission vertretenen Position. OceanCare begrüßt diese klare Haltung Frankreichs und hofft, dass dies ähnliche Verpflichtungen von anderen Staaten auf der ganzen Welt auslösen wird.



Schutz der Hohen See:



- Es wurde darauf hingewiesen, wie wichtig es ist, die Ambitionen für einen rechtlich verbindlichen Hochseevertrag zu erhöhen und die Verhandlungen im August in New York abzuschließen.



- Für OceanCare ist von entscheidender Bedeutung: die Dringlichkeit des Abschlusses der Verhandlungen im August darf die inhaltlichen Ambitionen nicht schwächen.



Beteiligung der Zivilgesellschaft:



- Der Rahmenbedingungen beim offiziellen Programm der Konferenz waren teilweise nicht hilfreich für den Meinungsaustausch zwischen Regierungen und anderen Interessengruppen. Obwohl als ""interaktive Dialoge"" bezeichnet, war eine sinnvolle persönliche Beteiligung der Zivilgesellschaft kaum möglich, die den Entscheidungsträgern wichtige Fachkenntnisse und Perspektiven vermittelt hätte.



""Die Einschränkung der Beteiligung der Zivilgesellschaft und der Möglichkeit, sich zu Wort zu melden, ist ein besorgniserregendes Signal. Sie steht im Widerspruch zu den Grundsätzen der Inklusivität und Transparenz, denen sich das internationale System bei politischen Prozessen verschrieben hat"", so McLellan.



""Die zweite Ozean-Konferenz muss als Teil eines längeren Prozesses zur Erreichung der UNO-Agenda 2030 gesehen werden. OceanCare fordert, dass Regierungen und andere Interessengruppen alle Maßnahmen, zu denen sie sich verpflichtet haben, mit der notwendigen Dringlichkeit umsetzen"", so Carlos Bravo, Ozeanpolitikexperte bei OceanCare, abschließend.

Umweltschutzorganisation kritisiert MSC-Standard - Greenpeace fordert ein Hochseeschutz-Abkommen statt Greenwashing-Gütezeichen

Wien (OTS) - Die Umweltschutzorganisation Greenpeace warnt vor den Fisch-Siegeln MSC und ASC. Das vermeintliche Öko-Label MSC etwa steht in Zusammenhang mit zerstörerischen Fangmethoden, wie dem Einsatz von Grundschleppnetze durch Industrie-Fangflotten. Auch der zum dritten Mal erneuerte MSC-Standard wird keine deutliche Verbesserung für die Meere erbringen. Das Fischgütesiegel ASC für Aquakultur ist aus Sicht von Greenpeace ebenfalls nicht empfehlenswert, da beispielsweise weiterhin Chemikalien und Antibiotika auf ASC-Farmen über die vorgeschriebenen Limits hinausgehen. Statt Greenwashing-Gütezeichen, die den Konsument:innen hohe Standards suggerieren, fordert Greenpeace ein Hochseeschutz-Abkommen für mindestens 30 Prozent der Meere.

“Das Geschäft mit dem vermeintlich nachhaltigen Fischfang spült bares Geld in die Kassen von MSC. Anstatt für wahren Meeresschutz einzutreten, wird hier auf Profit gesetzt und die Meere leergefischt”, sagt Ursula Bittner, Wirtschaftsexpertin von Greenpeace. Trotz anhaltender Kritik stehen zerstörerische Fangmethoden bei MSC an der Tagesordnung. Etwa werden bodenberührende Grundschleppnetze, die die Unterwasserwelt verwüsten, eingesetzt. Auch eine hohe Beifang-Rate wird toleriert. Zudem wird das MSC-Siegel auch für Fisch aus bereits überfischten Beständen vergeben, wenn ein Erholungsprogramm für den betreffenden Fischbestand existiert.

“Der Verein hat kein ehrliches Interesse an Meeresschutz, sondern daran, dass immer mehr Fischfangflotten sein Siegel kaufen und immer mehr Fisch verkauft wird. Doch die Meere sind kein Selbstbedienungsladen, sondern empfindliche Ökosysteme, die lebensnotwendig für unsere Erde sind. Der Meeresfisch-Konsum muss jedenfalls weltweit drastisch reduziert werden. Akzeptabel ist nur kleinräumige, handwerkliche Fischerei. Aber wenn schon Fisch, dann aus Österreich”, sagt Bittner. Greenpeace fordert ein starkes Hochseeschutz-Abkommen, das die Grundlage für weitreichende Meeresschutzgebiete darstellen würde. Bis 2030 müssen 30 Prozent aller Weltmeere unter Schutz stehen. Insbesondere in Meeresschutzgebieten müssen industrielle Aktivitäten vollständig ausgeschlossen werden.

Video of সেন্টমার্টিন: ডিক্যাপ্রিওর ভালোবাসা - DiCaprio greets BD as St Martin declared marine protected area

DiCaprio said that this move will safeguard the biodiversity in that significant area

In a tweet on Friday at 8:30 pm (Bangladesh time), he wrote, ""Congrats to the Government of Bangladesh, local communities and NGOs on a newly established Marine Protected Area around Saint Martin's Island that will protect an incredible community of biodiversity and provide key habitat for Bangladesh's only coral reef.""

DiCaprio also shared a photograph crediting Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), showcasing the picturesque view of the mentioned area.

""This newly declared marine protected area spans 672 square miles on Bangladesh's southernmost tip,"" he said.

DiCaprio, one of the highest-paid actors in the world and the winner of three Golden Globes and an Oscar (for best actor), has been campaigning in the fight against climate change for years.

Additionally, his Leonardo Dicaprio Foundation (LDF) addresses the world's most pressing environmental concerns including the conservation of the ocean and wildlife and global warming by partnering with other international organisations, such as the World Wildlife Fund, Oceana, and the Wild Foundation.

Moreover, the latest documentary film he produced called ""The Loneliest Whale"" (2021) raises awareness about the dangers faced by marine life such as overfishing, global warming, and noise pollution.

Unsurprisingly, Dicaprio dedicates most of his social media posts to climate-related news. However, reportedly this is the first time Bangladesh appeared in one of his tweets.

The government recently declared about 1,743 square kilometres of the Bay of Bengal adjacent to Saint Martin's Island as ""Saint Martin Marine Protected Area"" to conserve marine biodiversity.

Congrats to the Government of Bangladesh, local communities & NGOs on a newly established Marine Protected Area around Saint Martin's Island that will protect an incredible community of biodiversity and provide key habitat for Bangladesh's only coral reef.

In addition to the previously declared 590 hectares of ecologically critical area, the new 70 metres deep marine protected area has been declared to prevent uncontrolled movement of water vessels, overfishing, dumping of waste and chemicals, and destruction of coral reefs and biodiversity.

The newly declared protected area will help conserve the endangered pink dolphins, sharks, ray fish, sea turtles, seabirds, corals, marine grasses and marine biodiversity and their habitats.

It will also help improve the livelihoods of local people through sustainable extraction of marine resources, enrich the national blue economy, and achieve the international obligations and targets related to the special economic zone of Bangladesh.

The declaration of this marine protected area will facilitate the proper enforcement of the law and proper management of marine resources with the help of law enforcement agencies deployed in and around the island.

The Oscar-winning actor is identified as one of the most active celebrities in the climate change movement, and dedicates most of his social media posts to climate-related news. This is reportedly the first time Bangladesh has appeared in one of his tweets.

The Bangladesh government recently declared around 1,743 square kilometres of area of the Bay of Bengal adjacent to Saint Martin's Island as marine protected area to conserve its rich biodiversity and ecosystem.

The island is now the largest marine protected area in the country.

In 1999, a total of 590 hectares of area of the island was declared as ecologically critical area.

With the new measure, the government hopes to protect the coral and marine aquatic life and marine biodiversity of the island.

Moreover, limiting sustainable extraction of marine resources from the protected area will result in increased marine fish resources and aquatic animal breeding, the authorities expect.

Earlier, 590 hectares of the island had been announced an ecologically critical area.

Issuing a press release yesterday, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said the decision was taken to help prevent uncontrolled ships and motor boats, overfishing, dumping of waste and harmful chemicals in the sea, destruction of coral colonies and depletion of the area's biodiversity.

St Martin's Island is now the second, and by far the largest, marine protected area in the country.

According to The Wildlife Conservation Protection Act-2012, under which the declaration was made, no person shall harvest, destroy or collect any natural resources or disturb or threaten any wildlife, destroy their habitat and pollute watercourse. It will even restrict people from entering the area without permission from the authorities.

However, people will be able to enter the area with permission, perhaps by paying an entry fee, for study or investigation purposes on relevant and helpful subjects on wildlife, photography, research, and ecotourism.

The declaration will help the authorities concerned enforce laws to limit extraction of marine resources from this protected area, which will ultimately increase marine fish resources and aquatic animal breeding there, said the release.",en,Cox's Bazar,"the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change",,"area, marine, island, st, martin, wildlife, resources, release, declaration, people"

The productive waters around this tropical island teem with biodiversity and provide key habitat for Bangladesh's only coral reef, as well as upwards of 230 finfish species.

The new MPA will also protect globally threatened wildlife such as Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, whale sharks, white-spotted whiprays, long-tailed butterfly rays, and olive ridley, green, and loggerhead turtles.

Also known as 'Coconut Island', Saint Martin's Island is a popular tourist destination and home to around 7,000 residents who depend on seasonal tourism and fishing.

Despite considerable efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of the area's booming tourism industry, over exploitation of corals and fisheries, along with uncontrolled waste and light pollution, have taken a heavy toll on marine biodiversity around the island.

Deputy Minister Habibun Nahar of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change said: ""The St. Martin's Island MPA, together with the existing Swatch-of-no-ground MPA and two other marine reserves declared by the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, brings Bangladesh one step closer towards achieving our national goal and international obligation under the Convention on Biodiversity and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to protect 10 per cent of our marine waters.""

Foreign Minister Dr A K Abdul Momen, while delivering the country statement at the plenary session of an international conference in Lisbon on Thursday, also said the measure has been taken to eliminate 'Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU)' fishing in its maritime waters.

The government also implemented its National Plan of Action in this regard in 2019.

Bangladesh is firm on its commitment to achieving all targets of the Sustainable Development Goal-14 titled 'Conserve and sustainably use the ocean, sea and marine resources for sustainable development, the minister told his audience at the 2nd UN Ocean Conference, the foreign ministry said in Dhaka on Friday.

Secretary at the Maritime Affairs Unit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh Rear Admiral (Retd) Md Khurshed Alam, Bangladesh Ambassador to Portugal Mr Tarik Ahsan and other officials were the delegation members accompanying the Foreign Minister at the UN meet.

During his deliberations, the Foreign Minister attached importance to marine science for ""eradicating poverty, contributing to food security, conserving the world's marine environment and resources, helping to predict and respond to natural and anthropogenic events and promoting sustainable development of the oceans and seas"".

""Under the able leadership and guidance of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh settled the maritime-boundary issues with both the neighbours (India and Myanmar) and is poised to collaboratively utilize the resources,"" he told the conference.

The government has amended Bangladesh Ship Recycle Act 2018 and set a target of compliance with the Hong Kong Convention by 2023.

Bangladesh also announced new actions aimed at ensuring safe ship recycling by 2023 and is the first amongst developing countries to take initiative to ban manufacture of single-use plastic shopping bags, the FM said.

Stressing the importance of capacity development and even distribution of scientific knowledge, he viewed those disparities in scientific capacity in terms of financial, technological, and human resources between developed and developing countries must be addressed for sustainable management of the oceans.

He affirmed that Bangladesh is ready to cooperate in keeping with its capabilities to actively engage with the developed countries willing to transfer marine science and marine technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions in accordance with the provisions of part XIV of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

The Foreign Minister arrived in Lisbon Thursday on a two-day visit to Portugal to lead the Bangladesh delegation to the UN ocean conference 2022.

Later, the minister visited the permanent Shaheed Minar situated at a public park of Lisbon, named Campo dos Mártires da Pátria, and paid his tribute to the language martyrs by placing floral wreaths.",en,"Myanmar, Dhaka, Bangladesh, Portugal, Lisbon, India","UN, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh, the Maritime Affairs Unit","Tarik Ahsan, Khurshed Alam","bangladesh, marine, minister, foreign, resources, conference, sustainable, development, area, lisbon"

“The EU has brought forward its most important commitments ever offered during an Our Ocean Conference, in terms of value,” the European Commission pointed out in a statement on Thursday.

The body stressed that the Our Ocean Conference presents an opportunity to countries, companies and the civil society to come forward with commitments to protect the ocean.

It added that the 2022 conference focused on identification of sustainable solutions for management of marine resources, protection of oceans and strengthening their resilience to climate change.

Virginijus Sinkevičius, European Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, pointed out that “the sum the EU is committing today is significant, but not as significant as the role that the ocean plays for our very existence.”

He noted that the ocean regulates the climate, filters air and is important for the economy, concluding that “the ocean is bringing all these benefits to us and we need to protect it… our future depends on it.”

The EC stressed that the EU’s commitments cover all important areas, including marine pollution, climate change, marine protected areas, promotion of sustainable aquaculture and more.

The Commission added that the bloc has developed a tracking tool to help citizens follow the implementation of the EU’s commitments.

The body pointed out that it is in the process of updating its International Ocean Governance Agenda to take into account the opportunities that the European Green Deal offers.

“The EU remains fully engaged in the Our Ocean process, and stands ready to assume its responsibility in relation to international ocean governance as a firm supporter of multilateralism,” the statement notes.

The Commission stressed that close to 500 million euro will go towards innovation, research and development in the period between 2021 and 2023, while roughly 55 million will go towards marine environment and climate change monitoring.

It concluded that the Mission Ocean will help the EU to achieve its environmental goals of protecting and restoring marine ecosystems, reducing pollution and use of chemical pesticides, and develop sustainable economic models.",en,"Palau, Belgium","Brussels Morning Newspaper, the European Commission, EC, Our Ocean, EU, Commission",Virginijus Sinkevičius,"ocean, eu, commitments, marine, conference, climate, protection, important, european, commission"

Cette nouvelle mouture doit améliorer le premier plan pour les déchets marins mis en place en 2017.

En moyenne, on trouve 3.875 déchets flottants par km² dans la partie belge de la mer du Nord et 137 déchets par 100 mètres de ligne de marée sur les plages, ce qui est largement supérieur au seuil prescrit par les règles européennes.

L'évaluation, en 2021, du premier plan d'action fédéral pour les déchets marins, élaboré en 2017, a montré que des mesures supplémentaires étaient nécessaires pour faire face au problème des déchets en mer. C'est pourquoi un nouveau plan contenant 25 actions concrètes a été élaboré sur la base des recommandations du premier plan d'action et en concertation avec un groupe de travail national et diverses parties prenantes.

Parmi ces actions on retrouve notamment la collecte de vieux engins de pêche et le recyclage de ceux-ci, la recherche d'alternatives à l'utilisation de plombs de pêche, la réduction de l'utilisation des produits à l'origine de la pollution marine, la sensibilisation des bateaux de plaisance, le nettoyage des épaves ou encore le développement du projet ""Fishing for Litter"", qui incite les navires de pêche belges à collecter les déchets en mer.

By Benjamin Flowers: Negotiators at the United Nations failed, again, to reach an agreement on a treaty to protect the oceans, after the fifth round of negotiations ended in an impasse on Saturday, the UK Independent reports.

Negotiators gathered in New York to discuss the details of a treaty that would set rules for protecting biodiversity in two-thirds of the world’s ocean areas that are outside of national jurisdictions.

Maxine Burkett, the United States deputy assistant secretary of state who was involved in negotiations, said that less than 1 percent of the high seas are protected without a new treaty, but that the treaty would increase the number to 30 percent.

Belize was represented at the negotiating table by Her Excellency Janine Felson, Ambassador to the United Nations. Felson stressed during negotiations that the timeliness of the agreement is important for Belize and other small island developing states (SIDS) countries, as delays will have an economic impact.

“Our livelihoods are directly dependent on the health of the ocean,” Felson said.

With the failure to reach an agreement, talks will be on hold until next year unless a special emergency session is called before the end of 2022.

""Hoy es muy buen día para la conservación de los océanos, pero también para la Humanidad”, afirmó en la ceremonia el presidente de Chile, Gabriel Boric, el impulsor de una iniciativa que forma parte de la ""diplomacia turquesa” que defiende.

Uno detrás de otro, firmaron el documento Boric, sus colegas de Colombia, Iván Duque; Perú, José Pedro Castillo; Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves; Ecuador, Guillermo Lasso, y Panamá, Laurentino Cortiz, así como los jefes de la diplomacia de Canadá, Mélanie Joly, y de México, Marcelo Ebrard, y el encargado de asuntos de clima de EE.UU., John Kerry.

Iniciativa de Chile en respaldo a los Acuerdos de París

La iniciativa lanzada hoy, afirmó Boric, respaldaba los compromisos asumidos en los Acuerdos de París, y para defenderlos los países signatarios se colocaron ""en la primera fila” para cumplirlos.

La idea, agregó el presidente chileno, era amarrar un compromiso ""con tres de las grandes crisis que afectan al mundo”, que son el cambio climático, la pérdida de la biodiversidad y el deterioro de los océanos.

""Vamos a trabajar por el establecimiento de una serie de áreas marinas protegidas que van a estar ecológicamente interconectadas, avanzando hacia estrategias regionales para la conservación de los océanos”, manifestó el presidente chileno.

La ONU avisa desde hace décadas del deterioro progresivo de los océanos por problemas viejos, como la pesca sin control, y de otros más recientes, como los microplásticos derivados de la basura que llega a los mares.

Desde que Naciones Unidas comenzó a alertar de este tema, a mediados de la década pasada, ya denunció que cerca de ocho millones de toneladas de plástico llegan cada año a los mares del Planeta y muchos de ellos son consumidos por los peces que alimentan a los humanos.

Pero Duque, a su turno, también alertó sobre otros dos efectos graves del deterioro de los océanos: la destrucción de los arrecifes coralinos y ""prácticas tan deleznables como la pesca de arrastre”.

Los nueve instan a China, Rusia, la India o la Unión Europea a unirse

""Los océanos son los principales sumideros naturales de carbono y como tales tienen un papel crucial frente a los efectos del cambio climático”, dijo Boric.

El pacto firmado hoy vincula a los países americanos con la mayor dependencia del Pacífico, pero también es una llamada de atención a otras regiones o países, como China, Rusia, la India o la Unión Europea, citados por Boric, con el fin de que se vinculen a estos mismos esfuerzos.

""Sabemos que la crisis climática no reconoce fronteras, y por eso tenemos que dar pasos concretos”, insistió Boric.

Fauna & Flora International (FFI) saves species from extinction and habitats from destruction, whilst improving the livelihoods of local people. Our guiding principles are to work through local partnerships, act as a catalyst for change, make conservation relevant and base decisions on sound science. Founded in 1903, FFI is the world's longest established international conservation body; our conservation work, and impact, spans the globe.

Please see link for an overview of current projects in Cambodia.

Coastal & Marine Conservation Programme

Starting in 2010, FFI Cambodia's Marine Programme supports coastal communities and the Royal Government of Cambodia through a programme of capacity building and technical support. Known locally as the Coastal & Marine Conservation Programme (CMCP), the programme's goal is to protect marine biodiversity and strengthen the resilience of coastal ecosystems and communities in Cambodia, working with partners to establish and manage Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).

A new Marine Protected Area (MPA) has been independently declared in the Great Bear Rainforest the Kitasoo Xai’xais Stewardship Authority announced on June 22.

“For decades we have worked with Canada and British Columbia to collaboratively form an MPA in Kitasu Bay (Gitdisdzu Lugyeks). We will continue to encourage that outcome, but can no longer wait until other governments act to preserve and protect this special place that is integral to our Nation,” Doug Neasloss, elected chief of the Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation said.

“Our right to establish this MPA comes from our inherent and Aboriginal Rights and Title and from our connection to this land for thousands of years.”

For the next three months, the Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation will be accepting public input on a draft management plan for the MPA.

They will also be sharing the plan with other stakeholders and governments. They would like to work with Canada and British Columbia to reach common objectives, Neasloss said. However, he clarified, they are not asking for permission.

“We note that the prime minister personally travelled to the Great Bear Coast in 2018 to sign the Reconciliation Framework Agreement, which included a commitment to establishing a network of Marine Protected Areas. The prime minister spoke about his commitment to marine conservation and the MPA network, and we trust he will support this step forward,” Neasloss said.

Jennifer Rice, North Coast MLA, had a previous career in marine-use planning. She understands that the Kitasoo Xai’xais are frustrated with how slow the process has been, she stated a June 24 email.

“I have been to Kitasu Bay with Chief Neasloss and have seen the tremendous abundance and sustenance it provides for people. Our government respects and acknowledges the efforts of First Nations to help protect ecosystems within their territories, through their declaration of Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas,” she stated.

“I am confident that the Kitasoo/Xai’xais and other coastal First Nations have a partner in our provincial government in rectifying this, particularly in regards to reconciliation and stewardship of B.C. land and waters.”

Kitasu Bay is a spiritual place for the First Nation, most of whom live in Klemtu, less than 20 kilometres away.

The 33.5 square kilometre area of ocean now under protection is home to seabirds, whales, salmon, cod, halibut, shellfish and vital kelp forests. The wildlife along with the lands and waters are important to the nation’s economy, health and culture.

Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation drafted a management plan that uses a science-based, Indigenous-led approach to conservation.

Guardian Watchmen will be part of monitoring, patrolling for poaching and conducting marine rescues.

Fisheries officers are sparse in remote regions such as Kitasu Bay which is why the Kitasoo Xai’xais Guardian Watchmen, who are already on the water every day, will be used to help manage the MPA.

“We know these lands and waters better than anyone, Kitasu Bay has been part of our home for thousands of years through to the present day. This coast is our lifeblood,” Hereditary Chief Nies’los (Kelly Robinson) said.

You can watch every episode of the series here.

Canada's marine environments are increasingly threatened by pressures such as plastic pollution, biodiversity loss and climate change.

But across the country, Indigenous stewards, scientists and environmental advocates are trying to help protect the health of the oceans.

""To me conservation is just a way of life,"" said Jordan Wilson, a member of the Heiltsuk Nation, which is on the coast, about 660 kilometres north of Vancouver.

""The Heiltsuk's people's beliefs of what conservation is, is not that we manage the land and the ocean. We believe in coexisting and taking stewardship of it. We take care of the environment and in turn it takes care of us.""

Stewardship for 700 generations

Wilson is a member of the Coastal Guardian Watchmen, a regional group of made up of stewards who monitor their territory to ensure resources are managed sustainably. Similar programs have been established in dozens of communities across the country, with funding support from the federal government.

Wilson says the programs recognize that Indigenous knowledge and stewardship practices have been proven to be some of the most effective ways of protecting biodiversity.

""The Heiltsuk practise is taking only what we need, leaving behind enough to ensure the preservation of what we are harvesting, making sure it will always come back to flourish,"" he said.

""I want to make sure that another 700 generations can continue to enjoy the beauty of the nature in our territory the way I do.""

WATCH | Protecting the ocean

Inuit-led Arctic preservation

In the Arctic, Inuit communities hold similar views of symbiotic relationships with and stewardship of the ocean. Justin Milton is a young Inuk who shares Wilson's conservation sentiments.

""Inuit and the Arctic Ocean are deeply intertwined, and that to me is much more than just the traditional sense of having marine conservation in the ocean,"" says Milton, an Inuk from Mittimatalik (Pond Inlet), about 1,065 km northwest of the capital Iqaluit, Nunavut.

Milton is the manager of Ikaarvik, an Inuit-led organization that connects researchers and scientists with Indigenous knowledge about the Arctic and its natural environments.

Tallurutiup Imanga covers an area more than twice the size of Nova Scotia. (Submitted by Parks Canada)

It's one of a series of initiatives in which Inuit have led the way in environmental protection and stewardship.

Other such projects include the creation of a new national marine conservation area called Tallurutiup Imanga, which covers about 110,000 square kilometres of ocean — more than twice the size of Nova Scotia. The protected area was announced by the federal government in conjunction with the government of Nunavut and the Qikqtani Inuit Association.

Milton says partnerships like that are a ""step in the right direction because not only will it protect the marine wildlife and ecosystem in the Arctic, but it also gives Inuit more self-determination and the waters that are traditionally used since time immemorial will be protected.""

Kitasoo Xai’xais First Nation (KXFN) elected Chief Doug Neasloss and the nation’s hereditary chiefs formally and unilaterally announced the Gitdisdzu Lugyeks (Kitasu Bay) Marine Protected Area (MPA), a 33.5-square-kilometre ocean protection zone in their traditional territories near Laredo Sound, 500 kilometres north of Vancouver. The KXFN and 16 other coastal nations, in partnership with the province and the federal government, have been involved in a two-decade-long marine planning process called MaPP to establish the B.C. Northern Shelf Marine Protected Area Network — a patchwork of MPAs across B.C.’s North Pacific Coast. Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s stated commitments — at home and on the world stage — to reconciliation, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and protecting 30 per cent of Canada’s oceans by 2030, progress on the marine network and individual First Nations’ desired MPAs has been frustratingly slow, Neasloss said. “We've been working with the federal government for a better part of 18 years and we still don't have protected areas,” he said.

“So if the federal government’s not going to do it, then we'll do it ourselves.” Kitasoo Xai’xais First Nation elected Chief Doug Neasloss said the KXFN does not need federal permission to establish a long-awaited marine protected area in its territory. Photo Moonfish Media / Kitasoo Xai’xais Stewardship Authority Ontario doubles down on gas-fired electricity generation, admits emissions will rise Public consultation on the MPA network and an associated action plan were originally planned for early 2021 and 2020, respectively. No formal announcements have been made by either the provincial or federal governments about when those milestones will actually take place.

The KXFN is the second coastal First Nation irked by inaction that has chosen to move ahead with protection plans in their territory with or without Ottawa on board. In May, the Mamalilikulla First Nation (MFN) celebrated the nation’s dedication of 10,416 hectares of land and sea in their traditional territory in Knight Inlet as an Indigenous Protected and Conserved Area (IPCA). The Kitasoo Xai’xais First Nation has unilaterally established a new marine protected area, citing long delays and inaction on the part of the federal government. The MFN is immediately concerned about a unique biological hot spot of cold-water corals and sponges in Hoeya Sound. The nation and conservationists have been trying to get Fisheries and Oceans Canada to establish an interim moratorium on commercial fishing in the fragile marine ecosystem for years, to no success. Trudeau travelled to the Great Bear Coast in 2018 to sign the Reconciliation Framework Agreement, which included commitments to marine conservation and establishing the MPA network in addition to co-ordinating the management of oceans with Pacific North Coast First Nations, Neasloss said. Map of the KXFN marine protected area on B.C.'s central coast.

While KXFN welcomes the co-operation from their longtime provincial and federal partners on the Gitdisdzu Lugyeks MPA, it has the authority and right to act immediately without them to protect special places sacred to the nation, he added. “Our right to establish this MPA comes from our inherent and Aboriginal rights and title and from our connection to this land for thousands of years,” Neasloss said. “While there’s a bit of frustration around missing a bunch of (federal) timelines and targets, it is also an opportunity for First Nations, at a government level, to make decisions.”",en,"B.C., Ontario, Canada, Vancouver, Ottawa","KXFN, MaPP, Kitasoo Xai’xais First Nation, Moonfish Media, National Observer, The Kitasoo Xai’xais First Nation, the Gitdisdzu Lugyeks, the Mamalilikulla First Nation, MFN, MPA, the B.C.

À l'instar d'autres espèces marines, ces animaux colorés font face à de nombreuses menaces, notamment la perte d'habitat et l'exploitation, sous forme de surpêche et de prises accessoires.

« Dans l'écosystème, il y a beaucoup d'espèces. Toutes ces espèces sont comme les rivets des ailes d’un avion. On peut en enlever plusieurs, mais à un certain point, on va perdre les ailes, et l’avion va tomber. » — Une citation de Amanda Vincent, directrice de Project Seahorse

Un rôle international

Depuis plus de 20 ans, Project Seahorse propose des mesures de conservation pour améliorer l'état des espèces et des habitats marins.

De 2000 à 2004, Amanda Vincent a présidé le groupe de travail sur les syngnathidés, la famille des poissons osseux à laquelle appartiennent les hippocampes, pour la Convention sur le commerce international des espèces appartenant à la faune et à la flore sauvages menacées d'extinction (CITES), réunissant 180 nations.

Project Seahorse a alors joué un rôle important dans la décision de la CITES de commencer à réglementer le commerce international des poissons marins.

L’année 2022 sera celle des océans, ont conclu une trentaine de chefs d'État en France la semaine dernière, au terme du One Ocean Summit de Brest. Les gouvernements et organisations promettent d’en faire plus pour protéger la haute mer, et entendent se battre contre l'invasion du plastique.

«Les décideurs sont en train de réaliser que les océans sont les régulateurs du climat, et qu’ils ne sont pas inépuisables», souligne l’océanographe de l’Université Laval, Philippe Archambault. «Ici [des dizaines de] pays se sont engagés dans des actions concrètes. Ils prennent ça au sérieux et ça ne peut être que positif.»

Conséquence de la crise climatique, les océans ne cessent de battre des records de chaleur.

AFP

Ils ont atteint en 2021 les températures les plus élevées jamais enregistrées, et ce, pour une troisième année consécutive, prévient une étude publiée en janvier dans Advances in Atmospheric Sciences.

• À lire aussi: Les océans n’ont jamais été aussi chauds

Sans grande surprise, l’activité humaine en est la principale cause.

Les océans absorbent près du tiers du dioxyde de carbone qu’elle émet, et plus de 90% de l’excès de chaleur générée par l’activité humaine.

Comme les forêts, ils sont des puits de carbone. Lorsque l’atmosphère est saturée de CO2, les océans en captent une partie et l’emmagasinent.

«L'activité humaine émet à peu près 10 milliards de tonnes de carbone par an: 45% restent dans l'atmosphère et 25% à 30% sont absorbés par l'océan», à France Info le chercheur au Laboratoire d'océanographie et du climat, Éric Guilyardi.

Des mesures rapides

Les dirigeants politiques qui se sont succédé à Brest, le 11 février, en présence ou en visioconférence, ont ainsi conclu qu’il fallait agir vite.

AFP Le président français Emmanuel Macron a reçu plusieurs chefs d'État à Brest, en Bretagne, pour le Sommet sur les océans qui se tenait du 9 au 11 février dernier.

«On se dit qu’on aurait dû agir plus tôt, mais ce n’est pas impossible de refroidir les océans. On a trouvé un vaccin contre la COVID-19 en 6 mois. Quand l’humain veut, il est capable», lance le professeur Archambault qui se décrit comme un «éternel optimiste».

Dans la ville portuaire de Bretagne, la présidente de la Commission européenne Ursula von der Leyen a annoncé le lancement d'une coalition comptant les 27 États membres de l'Union européenne (UE) et 16 autres pays, afin de conclure un traité destiné à protéger la haute mer.

«La haute mer n’est sous aucune juridiction. Il n’y a pas de réglementation», fait valoir Philippe Archambault. «Des voyous peuvent se permettre de vider les stocks poissons en toute impunité. Ça n’a pas de sens. Les océans appartiennent à l’humanité et ils ne sont pas réglementés.»

La France, l'Allemagne, l'Italie, l'Espagne et la Banque européenne d'investissement (BEI) porteront à 4 milliards d'euros (5,8 milliards de $) d'ici 2025 le montant du financement de Clean Ocean.

L'initiative européenne visant à réduire la pollution des fleuves et des mers due aux plastiques disposait jusqu'ici d'un financement de deux milliards d'euros (2,9 milliards de $) d'ici 2023.

Puis, les États-Unis se joindront à une cinquantaine de pays en plus de l'ensemble de l'UE pour soutenir le lancement de négociations pour un accord international contre la pollution provoquée par les 8,3 milliards de tonnes de plastiques produits depuis les années 1950.

AFP

Le lancement de ces négociations sera examiné lors de la 5e Assemblée des Nations Unies pour l'environnement, à la fin du mois de février.

Cartographier les océans

Promesse de l’UNESCO au Sommet sur les océans: au moins 80% des fonds marins seront cartographiés d’ici 2030.

Pour y arriver, l’organisation de l’ONU entend déployer une flotte de 50 navires consacrée à la tâche.

«Seulement 20% des océans sont cartographiés à l’heure actuelle. Ce n’est rien. C’est comme si on achetait une maison, mais qu’on n’allait pas visiter le sous-sol», illustre M. Archambault. «On a cartographié Mars et la Lune, mais on n’a même pas encore ouvert les armoires du sous-sol de la maison. Ça n’a aucun sens.»

Même si la mission peut sembler colossale, l’océanographe croit qu’elle n’est pas insurmontable.

Le budget fédéral alloué à la NASA a atteint 23,3 milliards de $ pour la période du 1er octobre 2020 au 30 septembre 2021.

Le Plan de protection des océans du gouvernement fédéral couvrira plus de régions

(Bowen Island) Le premier ministre Justin Trudeau a annoncé de nouveaux détails sur le plan de 3,5 milliards du gouvernement fédéral pour protéger les océans.

La Presse Canadienne

Dans son dernier budget, le gouvernement s’est engagé à ajouter 2 milliards sur neuf ans aux 1,5 milliard déjà réservés à la protection des océans.

Lors d’une conférence de presse en Colombie-Britannique, mardi, M. Trudeau a indiqué que le gouvernement avait maintenant lancé une version élargie du Plan de protection des océans.

« On va prendre des mesures pour lutter contre les nouvelles menaces à notre sécurité et à nos écosystèmes maritimes, et on va renforcer les partenariats avec les peuples autochtones », a déclaré M. Trudeau.

Ce qu’il appelle le Plan de protection des océans 2.0 « consiste à aller de l’avant avec de nouvelles mesures audacieuses avec des partenaires d’un océan à l’autre pour protéger et restaurer nos océans », a-t-il expliqué.

Plus de 50 initiatives ont été mises en œuvre depuis la création du plan en 2016. Par exemple, le gouvernement a rouvert d’importants centres d’intervention en cas d’incident, comme le Centre secondaire de sauvetage maritime de la Garde côtière canadienne de St. John’s, à Terre-Neuve et il a procédé au retrait et à l’élimination de centaines de bateaux abandonnés.

De plus, des mesures ont été prises pour protéger des espèces en péril, notamment l’épaulard résident du sud, et financer des initiatives pour la protection de la baleine noire de l’Atlantique Nord. Les nouveaux fonds visent à étendre ces efforts à davantage de régions.

M. Trudeau affirme que la nouvelle version du plan vise à maintenir les océans et les côtes en bonne santé, à faire progresser la réconciliation avec les peuples autochtones et à bâtir un avenir propre pour les futures générations.

Il soutient que « nous sommes chanceux » d’avoir autant d’espaces naturels au Canada et que « nous avons une responsabilité de nous en occuper ».

« Le gouvernement fédéral avant nous fermait les stations de la Garde côtière, sous-investissait, ignorait toute sorte de partenariat avec les peuples autochtones et licenciait des scientifiques », a affirmé M. Trudeau.

Il a mis de l’avant que son gouvernement doublait le plan initial pour les océans et qu’il serait « élargi et approfondi ».

Le ministre des Transports, Omar Alghabra, a indiqué que si les travaux de protection marine se sont poursuivis depuis l’annonce du plan pour les océans, les conditions ont changé.

« Le monde a changé au cours des deux dernières années. La pandémie, le changement climatique, les innovations dans l’industrie maritime et les défis de la chaîne d’approvisionnement affectent l’environnement marin », a-t-il spécifié.

C’est pourquoi le plan est élargi pour couvrir de nouvelles zones, notamment rendre le trafic maritime plus sûr, maintenir les chaînes d’approvisionnement en bonne santé et améliorer la réponse aux déversements d’hydrocarbures, a indiqué M. Alghabra.

La ministre des Pêches, des Océans et de la Garde côtière canadienne, Joyce Murray, a mentionné que le gouvernement travaillerait « en partenariat avec les peuples autochtones et les communautés côtières pour protéger les marins, les voies navigables et les rives du Canada, aujourd’hui et pour les générations à venir. »

Sondage

Un sondage d’opinion publique effectué auprès de 2700 personnes a révélé une sensibilisation limitée à la sécurité maritime, y compris les pratiques de navigation au Canada et la protection de l’environnement.

Le sondage commandé par le gouvernement fédéral a montré que 70 à 82 % des répondants croient que la protection de l’environnement marin est importante. Ce nombre est encore plus élevé pour ceux qui vivent dans les communautés côtières, selon le sondage de l’entreprise Ekos Research Associates.

Parmi les principaux éléments du Plan de protection des océans considérés comme importants par les personnes interrogées figure le renforcement des principes du pollueur-payeur pour s’assurer que les entreprises assument la responsabilité des déversements.

L’amélioration de la lutte contre la pollution, la protection et la restauration des écosystèmes côtiers ainsi que la protection des espèces de baleines en voie de disparition sont aussi des aspects importants pour les personnes sondées.

Les résultats suggèrent une plus grande confiance dans le plan que dans le système global de sécurité maritime. Environ 60 % des personnes qui ont participé au sondage ont déclaré être convaincues que le plan aurait un impact positif sur l’environnement et les espèces marines.

Toutefois, seulement 30 % des répondants ont dit avoir confiance dans la rapidité de l’intervention en cas de déversement d’hydrocarbures dans le cadre du système canadien et seulement 20 % croient que le plan garantit que les pollueurs industriels seront obligés de payer ou que les communautés touchées seront indemnisées.

For more than a decade, 17 coastal First Nations and the B.C. government have been actively involved in a marine planning process called MaPP to create the B.C. Northern Shelf Marine Protected Area Network — a patchwork of MPAs across the northern third of B.C.’s coast, said Mike Reid of the Heiltsuk Nation’s integrated resource department. The Haíłzaqv, Kitasoo Xai'xais, Nuxalk and Wuikinuxv First Nations, represented by the Central Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance (CCIRA), have invested heavily in terms of time and money in scientific and traditional research into their MPA areas and at the negotiating table, Reid said. Get daily news from Canada's National Observer “After spending 15 years now on the MPA process and then having DFO kind of stall the whole thing is challenging,” Reid said. Particularly given the federal Liberal government’s repeated commitments to protect 30 per cent of Canada’s oceans by 2030, increasing First Nations’ decision-making and stewardship in their territories, and shifting to an ecosystem-based approach to managing resources, Reid added.

While some fishing restrictions are proposed for some MPAs, measures would vary according to the conservation objectives of each area, he said. But it appears DFO is resisting proposed fishing regulations and doesn’t want to relinquish decision-making on fisheries in MPAs and instead wants to maintain the status quo, Reid said. The sticking point to moving forward with long-standing plans on marine protected areas on B.C.'s Central Coast is @DFO_Pacific's objections to proposed fisheries measures, say @coast_resource First Nations. #bcpoli #OceanProtections #MPAs “We’re not working to just protect water,” he said of the First Nations’ goals. “That's not our intent. We want broad ecosystem and biodiversity protections for species.” While the B.C. government has been actively involved in the lengthy marine planning process, participation by DFO Pacific Region fisheries management has been spotty, Reid said.

Despite attempts to engage and get feedback from DFO’s Pacific fisheries branch, little was offered, he added. “Throughout the whole process, fisheries management, and DFO in general, were actually absent from our whole process,” he said. “Despite several attempts to engage them, it was for the most part fruitless.”",en,"Canada, B.C.","@coast_resource First Nations, MaPP, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, DFO Pacific Region, the Central Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance, National Observer, the First Nations’ goals, @DFO_Pacific's, the B.C.

Dans son dernier budget, le gouvernement s'est engagé à ajouter 2 milliards de dollars sur neuf ans aux 1,5 milliards de dollars déjà réservés à la protection des océans .

Lors d'une conférence de presse en Colombie-Britannique, mardi, Justin Trudeau a indiqué que le gouvernement avait lancé une version élargie du Plan de protection des océans.

« On va prendre des mesures pour lutter contre les nouvelles menaces à notre sécurité et à nos écosystèmes maritimes, et on va renforcer les partenariats avec les peuples autochtones », a déclaré M. Trudeau.

Plus de 50 initiatives ont été mises en œuvre depuis la création du plan en 2016 selon Ottawa. Par exemple, le gouvernement a rouvert d'importants centres d'intervention en cas d'incident, comme le Centre secondaire de sauvetage maritime de la Garde côtière canadienne de St. John's, à Terre-Neuve.

De plus, des mesures ont été prises pour protéger des espèces en péril, notamment l'épaulard résident du Sud, et financer des initiatives pour la protection de la baleine noire de l'Atlantique Nord. Les nouveaux fonds visent à étendre ces efforts à davantage de régions.

M. Trudeau affirme que la nouvelle version du plan vise à maintenir les océans et les côtes en bonne santé, à faire progresser la réconciliation avec les peuples autochtones et à bâtir un avenir propre pour les futures générations.

We will be joined by Charlotte Dawe, Conservation and Policy Campaigner at Wilderness Committee to dive into the topic of marine species at risk.

We cannot survive without the ocean; it provides us oxygen to breathe, puts food on our plates, helps us fight climate change, and supports vibrant coastal communities. Yet, we continue to overexploit and pollute the ocean. We are driving alarming species decline, disrupting diverse ecosystems, and damaging our long-term future.

The vast majority of Canada’s oceans are not legally protected, leaving marine species and their habitats vulnerable. As the country boasting the longest coastline on Earth, we aren’t doing enough to conserve it.

We can choose a better future for us and for the ocean—one that respects Indigenous rights and supports Indigenous-led visions for marine conservation.

Join us for an engaging webinar on marine species at risk in the context of Canada’s oceans!

Trudeau Announces $2 Billion Ocean Protection Plan, Criticizes Previous Government’s Approach

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticized the previous Harper government’s approach to protecting the oceans on Tuesday while announcing $2 billion in additional funding to protect ocean ecosystems.

Trudeau held a press conference with other ministers on Bowen Island, B.C., to present the new investment enclosed in the government’s last budget released in April.

When asked by a reporter what he was most proud of regarding the Oceans Protection Plan, Trudeau said “one of the things that was absolutely essential was moving back into the space of saying that our oceans need to be protected.”

“It seems so obvious, particularly standing here all together, but the federal government prior to us was shuttering Coast Guard stations, was under-investing, was ignoring any sorts of partnerships with indigenous peoples, and firing scientists,” he said.

The Liberal government launched the first iteration of the Oceans Protection Plan in 2016 with a $1.5 billion price tag, which was touted as the largest investment to protect coasts and waterways.

The additional $2 billion announced in Budget 2022 is projected to be spent over the next nine years, starting in 2022–2023.

Trudeau said the new funding will build on the “tremendous actions, results, and success” of the plan to strengthen partnerships with indigenous communities, increase research, and protect vulnerable species and areas.

Transport Minister Omar Alghabra, who spoke at the press conference with Trudeau, listed some of the achievements of the protection plan in recent years.

He said two new Coast Guard stations were opened in B.C. along with the reopening of four others across Canada.

The Harper government had closed stations as part of deep budget cuts across the government to balance the budget by 2015–2016.

Among other achievements, Alghabra said 500 abandoned boats that were a hazard to navigation were removed or assessed, and 223 endangered species were recovered.

“The Oceans Protection Plan will be enhanced to make large and small ship traffic safer on our waters, keep supply chains healthy, strong, and resilient, increase our emergency preparedness response, recovery, and research into marine pollution beyond oil spills, and introduce even stronger protection for ecosystems, wildlife, including our endangered whale population,” he said.

Fisheries and Oceans Minister Joyce Murray said the new funding will be used to acquire Coast Guard vessels for Arctic rescue.

Other plans under her purview include increasing maritime security training and the capabilities of the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, a volunteer marine association involved in search and rescue.",en,"Squamish Nation, B.C., Canada, Bowen Island","Transport, Coast Guard, the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, Fisheries and Oceans, The Canadian Press","Omar Alghabra, Darryl Dyck, Patrick Weiler, Justin Trudeau, Joyce Murray","trudeau, government, protection, plan, oceans, minister, new, budget, coast, guard"

MP Rachel Blaney wrote the minister in charge of Transport Omar Alghabra to share local people’s concerns about ocean protections in the wake of the incident.

“All the ministers who have responsibility for our coast need to hear from our communities on this,” said Blaney. “I intend to make sure they do.”

This submission was in response to the consultation process for the Oceans Protection Program (OPP). Blaney’s submission drew on feedback from constituents and touched on the need to address the gap and oversight between departments, developing an emergency response plan, holding companies accountable, and promoting the use of sustainable packaging.

The letter highlights MP Lisa Marie Barron, NDP critic for Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guards’ motion, which looks at the Emergency coastal debris spill response plan. The motion calls for the government to: “immediately deploy a local workforce to support spill containment, shoreline cleanup, and mitigation of environmental impacts, publicly release a full accounting of the environmental impacts of the spillage, including a manifest of all missing cargo, ensure that the operators are held financially liable for the full cost of the cleanup.”

Blaney said she worked with people doing cleanups in affected areas, saying that “often the work continues long past the time we have stopped considering the impacts of the spills.”

The letter includes feedback from constituents, asking for more accountability, a reduction in the use of non-biodegradable packaging in products shipped overseas, local response teams, and for higher standards of ships entering Canadian waters as well as other regulations. It also suggests advocating for a change in mindset when it comes to shopping.

“We shop too much, therefore we ship too much,” the feedback portion of the letter, which summarizes thoughts directly from constituents, says. “The issue is our consumerism mindset and that we define our status and self worth by what we own. We see trade across the oceans as necessary, and I think we need to change that thinking.

“We should be asking ‘what do we really need and why can’t we get by with what we can produce here in our own local area and country?’” the section says. “We need to… educate our children on ways to survive with less, to want less. Stop promoting the term ‘middle class.’

“We only need the basic needs of housing, clean water, locally available food and a sense of community,” it says.

Blaney is continuing to meet with stakeholders and asking for more feedback from local residents on this issue online at rachelblaney.ndp.ca/protectourcoast.

Local Journalism Initiative Reporter

A new Marine Protected Area (MPA) has been independently declared in the Great Bear Rainforest the Kitasoo Xai’xais Stewardship Authority announced on June 22.

“For decades we have worked with Canada and British Columbia to collaboratively form an MPA in Kitasu Bay (Gitdisdzu Lugyeks). We will continue to encourage that outcome, but can no longer wait until other governments act to preserve and protect this special place that is integral to our Nation,” Doug Neasloss, elected chief of the Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation said.

“Our right to establish this MPA comes from our inherent and Aboriginal Rights and Title and from our connection to this land for thousands of years.”

For the next three months, the Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation will be accepting public input on a draft management plan for the MPA.

They will also be sharing the plan with other stakeholders and governments. They would like to work with Canada and British Columbia to reach common objectives, Neasloss said. However, he clarified, they are not asking for permission.

“We note that the prime minister personally travelled to the Great Bear Coast in 2018 to sign the Reconciliation Framework Agreement, which included a commitment to establishing a network of Marine Protected Areas. The prime minister spoke about his commitment to marine conservation and the MPA network, and we trust he will support this step forward,” Neasloss said.

Jennifer Rice, North Coast MLA, had a previous career in marine-use planning. She understands that the Kitasoo Xai’xais are frustrated with how slow the process has been, she stated a June 24 email.

“I have been to Kitasu Bay with Chief Neasloss and have seen the tremendous abundance and sustenance it provides for people. Our government respects and acknowledges the efforts of First Nations to help protect ecosystems within their territories, through their declaration of Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas,” she stated.

“I am confident that the Kitasoo/Xai’xais and other coastal First Nations have a partner in our provincial government in rectifying this, particularly in regards to reconciliation and stewardship of B.C. land and waters.”

Kitasu Bay is a spiritual place for the First Nation, most of whom live in Klemtu, less than 20 kilometres away.

The 33.5 square kilometre area of ocean now under protection is home to seabirds, whales, salmon, cod, halibut, shellfish and vital kelp forests. The wildlife along with the lands and waters are important to the nation’s economy, health and culture.

Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation drafted a management plan that uses a science-based, Indigenous-led approach to conservation.

Guardian Watchmen will be part of monitoring, patrolling for poaching and conducting marine rescues.

Fisheries officers are sparse in remote regions such as Kitasu Bay which is why the Kitasoo Xai’xais Guardian Watchmen, who are already on the water every day, will be used to help manage the MPA.

“We know these lands and waters better than anyone, Kitasu Bay has been part of our home for thousands of years through to the present day. This coast is our lifeblood,” Hereditary Chief Nies’los (Kelly Robinson) said.

Le transport maritime est l’un des moyens les plus sûrs, les plus propres et les plus rentables de transporter des marchandises. Alors que nous continuons à nous remettre de la pandémie de COVID-19, les Canadiens s’attendent à un système maritime sécuritaire et efficace qui appuie notre chaîne d’approvisionnement, maintient la propreté de nos côtes et protège nos écosystèmes locaux. C’est pourquoi le Plan de protection des océans, en partenariat avec les peuples autochtones et les communautés côtières, comprend des mesures proactives pour veiller à ce que le système de sécurité maritime de calibre mondial du Canada soit plus solide que jamais.

Depuis 2016, le Plan de protection des océans investit dans des solutions visant à renforcer notre système de sécurité maritime. Le financement annoncé aujourd’hui s’appuie sur ces efforts et s’étend à de nouveaux domaines, notamment :

en améliorant la prévention, la préparation et l’intervention en cas d’urgence maritime au Canada, y compris pour couvrir plus de types de pollution marine au-delà des déversements d’hydrocarbures;

en appliquant de nouvelles technologies et en établissant de nouveaux partenariats avec les peuples autochtones et les communautés locales pour accroître l’efficacité du transport maritime et réduire les répercussions négatives sur les écosystèmes marins;

en investissant dans des technologies qui permettront de répondre au trafic accru de cargaisons et de navires qui traversent les eaux canadiennes;

en assurant la sécurité des déplacements et de la navigation des petits et grands navires afin d’améliorer la sécurité sur l’eau et de limiter les risques pour les espèces marines;

en accroissant la capacité du Programme national de surveillance aérienne grâce à un nouveau hangar et à une nouvelle unité d’hébergement à Iqaluit afin de renforcer la surveillance de la pollution marine dans la région de l’Arctique.

Depuis son lancement en 2016, le Plan de protection des océans a permis de renforcer la protection de nos côtes et de notre faune, d’améliorer la sécurité maritime, et de faire progresser les partenariats avec les communautés autochtones.

Aujourd’hui, le ministre des Transports, l’honorable Omar Alghabra, et le député de Saint John—Rothesay, Wayne Long, a annoncé un investissement pouvant aller jusqu’à 447 millions de dollars pour protéger et restaurer les écosystèmes côtiers davantage partout au Canada, dans le cadre de la prochaine phase du Plan de protection des océans du Canada.

Depuis son lancement en 2016, le Plan de protection des océans du Canada a accru la protection de nos écosystèmes marins et de nos espèces marines, notamment grâce à la restauration de 60 écosystèmes marins à l’échelle nationale. À l’avenir, le Plan de protection des océans continuera de protéger ces zones côtières importantes grâce à des mesures comme celles qui suivent :

enlever et éliminer les épaves et les bâtiments abandonnés ou dangereux afin de réduire les risques pour la navigation et les conséquences néfastes sur nos eaux partout au pays;

fournir du nouveau financement pour des projets de restauration des milieux aquatiques dans les communautés côtières et intérieures en amont qui protègent et restaurent les zones côtières du Canada;

réduire les risques et atténuer les dommages causés par le transport maritime sur les habitats marins et les communautés côtières;

imposer une interdiction d’utilisation et de transport du mazout lourd pour de nombreux navires dans l’Arctique canadien, réduisant ainsi le risque de déversements de mazout lourd dans la région;

collaborer avec les peuples autochtones et les communautés côtières pour mener de nouvelles évaluations régionales des effets cumulatifs du transport maritime et déterminer des mesures d'atténuation potentielles;

investir dans la recherche scientifique, la surveillance et les mesures de protection afin de réduire les répercussions des activités de transport maritime et de la circulation liée aux navires sur les baleines et les mammifères marins.

Rankin Inlet (Nunavut) - L’océan Arctique fournit des ressources vitales aux collectivités nordiques du Canada. Il constitue un corridor de transport capital pour le réapprovisionnement communautaire, fournit des ressources alimentaires, et fait partie intégrante de l’identité culturelle nordique. Il s’avère donc fondamental d’assurer la sécurité de ces eaux, et c’est pourquoi le gouvernement du Canada investit de manière significative en vue d’améliorer la sécurité maritime dans le Nord canadien dans le cadre de la prochaine phase du Plan de protection des océans.

Aujourd’hui,la ministre des Pêches, des Océans et de la Garde côtière canadienne, l’honorable Joyce Murray, a annoncé le financement de deux initiatives distinctes dans l’Arctique.

1.) Amélioration des activités du Service hydrographique du Canada (SHC) dans l’Arctique

Ce nouveau financement de 84 millions de dollars permettra au SHC de poursuivre son travail visant à améliorer les services hydrographiques modernes de cartographie des fonds marins, qui contribuent directement à la sécurité de la navigation dans l’Arctique. Le SHC effectuera des levés hydrographiques à l’aide de nouvelles technologies, telles que les navires hydrographiques autonomes et la télédétection par satellite, afin de relever les défis posés par l’hydrographie de l’Arctique. Il fournira également de nouvelles cartes marines et de nouveaux produits nautiques dans les zones prioritaires. Ce financement permettra aussi aux collectivités de l’Arctique et du Canada de collaborer avec le SHC en vue de recueillir et d’utiliser des données hydrographiques, améliorant ainsi leur compréhension des fonds marins locaux.

Grâce au financement antérieur du Plan de protection des océans, le SHC a été en mesure d’accroître sa couverture hydrographique des corridors de navigation de l’Arctique, et de publier 72 nouvelles cartes de navigation électroniques. En s’appuyant sur ces réalisations, le financement annoncé aujourd’hui permettra d’accroître davantage la sécurité maritime dans l’Arctique.

2.) Amélioration des activités de la Garde côtière canadienne (GCC) dans l’Arctique

Ce nouveau financement de 24,7 millions de dollars améliorera les capacités d’intervention de la GCC à Rankin Inlet. Mise sur pied dans le cadre de la première phase du Plan de protection des océans, la première station de recherche et de sauvetage de la Garde côtière canadienne dans l’Arctique a ouvert ses portes en tant que station d’embarcations de sauvetage côtier à Rankin Inlet, au Nunavut, en août 2018. Grâce à ce financement supplémentaire, la station sera transformée en station d’intervention maritime dans l’Arctique.

La GCC utilisera ces ressources pour embaucher et former des membres d’équipage supplémentaires provenant des collectivités locales; pour prolonger la saison d’exploitation de la station d’un mois par année à compter de 2023, en vue de mieux coïncider avec la saison complète de navigation libre de glace dans la région; pour acquérir un navire de recherche et de sauvetage supplémentaire, construit spécialement pour les opérations dans l’Arctique; et pour apporter des améliorations additionnelles à l’infrastructure afin d’optimiser les capacités opérationnelles.

La station de la GCC à Rankin Inlet fournit des services de recherche et de sauvetage maritime pendant la saison en eau libre. Les équipages répondent aux appels de détresse, qu’il s’agisse d’un navire chaviré, d’un bateau qui prend l’eau ou d’une urgence médicale. L’équipage de la station joue un rôle important dans le système de préparation et d’intervention en cas d’urgence dans le Nord, en toute collaboration avec les auxiliaires de la GCC, les Inuits et les premiers intervenants locaux afin d’accroître la sécurité maritime dans les eaux arctiques.

Le Plan de protection des océans constitue une véritable réussite canadienne. Lorsque les peuples autochtones, l’industrie, les collectivités, le milieu universitaire et le gouvernement travaillent ensemble pour protéger notre environnement, faire croître notre économie et soutenir de bons emplois partout au pays, nous obtenons des résultats concrets. Un Plan de protection des océans renouvelé et élargi permettra de préserver la santé de nos océans et de nos côtes, de faire progresser la réconciliation, et de bâtir un avenir propre pour nos enfants et nos petits-enfants.",fr,"Canada, Nunavut, Rankin Inlet","les Inuits, SHC, les auxiliaires de la GCC, la Garde côtière canadienne et du Service hydrographique du Canada, le milieu universitaire, GCC",Joyce Murray,"l’arctique, financement, station, plan, protection, océans, canadienne, canada, sécurité, maritime"

58,2022-07-20,Trudeau inanunsyo ang pinalawak na ocean protection plan,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/tl/balita/1899484/trudeau-expanded-ocean-protection-plan,6,5,1,0,ici.radio-canada.ca,Canada,"Sa pinakahuling budget, nangako ang gobyerno na magdadagdag ng $2 bilyon sa susunod na siyam na taon sa $1.5 bilyon na nakatabi na para sa proteksyon ng karagatan.

Nang magsalita sa isang news conference sa Bowen Island, British Columbia B.C. , sinabi ni Trudeau na naglunsad ang gobyerno ngayon ng pinalawak na bersyon ng Oceans Protection Plan.

Kasama sa mga inisyatiba na pinondohan ng programa ang pagbubukas ng anim na istasyon ng coast guard sa British Columbia at Newfoundland and Labrador, pagtataguyod ng isang Indigenous-led coast guard auxiliary sa British Columbia B.C. , ang restorasyon ng coastal aquatic habitats, at ang pagtanggal at pagtapon ng daan-daang abandonadong mga barko.

Pinondohan din nito ang mga gawain upang protektahan ang mga species na nanganganib, kabilang ang resident killer whales at North Atlantic right whales.

Ang bagong pondo ay nakatuon sa pagpapalawak ng katulad na environmental at safety efforts sa mas maraming rehiyon. Sinabi ni Trudeau na ang pinakahuling plano ay nakalaan para panatilihin na malusog ang mga karagatan at baybayin, isulong ang rekonsilyasyon at itaguyod ang isang malinis na kinabukasan.

Ipinakita ng inisyatiba na ang kanyang gobyerno ay bumabalik sa espasyo ng pagsasabi na ang mga karagatan ay dapat protektahan, aniya.

Ang pederal na gobyerno bago tayo ay isinara ang mga istasyon ng coast guard, nag-under-investing, hindi pinansin ang anumang uri ng partnership sa Indigenous Peoples (mga katutubo) at sinipa sa trabaho ang mga siyentipiko.

Sinabi niya na pinapalakas ng kanyang gobyerno ang ocean plan na inilunsad noong 2016 (bagong window) at gagawin itong mas malawak at mas malalim.

Sinabi ni Joyce Murray, minister ng fisheries, oceans at ng Canadian Coast Guard, na ang gobyerno ay makikipagtulungan kasama ang Indigenous Peoples at coastal communities upang protektahan ang mga marinero, daanan ng tubig at baybayin ng Canada ngayon, at para sa susunod na mga henerasyon.

Maintain biodiversity of individual species, communities, and populations within the different ecotypes; and

Safeguard habitat, including the physical and chemical properties of the ecosystem, by maintaining water and sediment quality. Prohibitions The Musquash Estuary MPA Regulations prohibit activities that disturb, damage, destroy or remove from this Area living marine organisms or any part of their habitat, unless listed as exceptions in the Regulations or approved by the Minister. Environmental Context Musquash Estuary Marine Protected Area (MPA) is located 20 km southwest of Saint John, New Brunswick; its boundary is defined by the water level at low tide. Musquash is unique among Bay of Fundy estuaries due to its size, expansive salt marshes, and natural condition. It is the largest, ecologically-intact estuary in the Bay of Fundy. This productive habitat is home to many birds, mammals, fish, invertebrates, and marine plants. Estuaries are often surrounded by low-lying coastal grasslands, called salt marshes, which are frequently covered by the tide. These salt marshes perform a variety of functions. They filter sediment and pollutants, buffer coastal lands from storm surges and floods, prevent erosion, and stabilize shorelines. In the Bay of Fundy, more than 85% of the original salt marshes have been altered by humans over the past 300 years.

Ecosystem Ecosystem An estuary is a partially-enclosed body of coastal water into which freshwater flows from rivers and streams, mixing with the saltwater from the ocean. Estuaries are considered one of the Earth's most productive ecosystems, hosting several habitat types that support a diverse range of wildlife. They are often surrounded by low-lying coastal grasslands, called salt marshes, which are frequently covered by the tide. These salt marshes perform a variety of functions. They filter sediment and pollutants, buffer coastal lands from storm surges and floods, prevent erosion, and stabilize shorelines. In the Bay of Fundy, more than 85% of the original salt marshes have been altered by humans over the past 300 years. Musquash is unique among Bay of Fundy estuaries due to its size, expansive salt marshes, and natural condition. It is the largest, ecologically-intact estuary in the Bay of Fundy, and exhibits an abundance of wildlife and commercial fisheries. The estuary's location, shape, and oceanographic characteristics support diverse habitat and high marine biological productivity. Fisheries and Oceans Canada is committed to conserving and protecting the Musquash Estuary MPA and intertidal area and the species that thrive there. It is aided in its efforts by owners and managers of the surrounding land, including Ducks Unlimited Canada, Eastern Habitat Joint Venture, Nature Conservancy of Canada, Province of New Brunswick, and Government of Canada. The Conservation Council of New Brunswick, through its advocacy work, also contributes to the conservation and protection of the Musquash Estuary ecosystem.

Management and Conservation Management and Conservation The boundary of the Musquash Estuary MPA is defined by the water level at low tide. Most of the intertidal area – the area exposed to air at low tide and underwater at high tide – is administered by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and is referred to as the Administered Intertidal Area. DFO works to conserve and protect the habitats and species that thrive in this ecosystem. Conservation and protection of the ecosystem is the primary goal of management, and specific conservation objectives have been established. The Musquash Estuary encompasses unique habitats, and areas of high biological diversity and biological productivity, and is an area of importance for a variety of commercial and non-commercial fisheries. These characteristics provide the foundation for conservation and protection objectives for the MPA and Administered Intertidal Area ecosystem. The conservation objectives are to ensure no unacceptable reduction or human-caused modification in: Productivity, so that harvested species remain healthy and abundant;

Biodiversity, so that the diversity of individual species, communities, and populations within the different ecotypes are maintained; and

Habitat, to safeguard the physical and chemical properties of the ecosystem by maintaining water and sediment quality. The conservation objectives will be achieved by addressing management priorities and through the implementation of management actions outlined in the management plan. The Musquash Estuary MPA Management Plan guides management of the MPA and Administered Intertidal Area. The management plan provides details on: the purpose and scope; the legislative authority in the Musquash Estuary, the transfer of administration and control of lands to the Government of Canada from the Province of New Brunswick and the federal authority to manage the estuary; the background to the designation as an MPA; the management vision, guiding principles, conservation objectives and management priorities the Musquash Estuary MPA Regulations and approach for managing activities within the administered intertidal area under the Fisheries Act; and, the governance structure. The Musquash Estuary MPA Advisory Committee (MAC) facilitates dialogue between DFO and MPA rights holders and stakeholders concerning management plan implementation. MAC members represent government, non-government organizations, industry, First Nations, and community groups with an interest in the MPA. They provide skills, knowledge, and experience related to the ecology, management, conservation, and general use of the MPA. Musquash Estuary: A management plan for the marine protected area and administered intertidal area Evaluation and Reporting: A review of Musquash Estuary MPA management [PDF] was recently conducted to measure DFO’s progress towards meeting the commitments laid out in the Musquash Estuary MPA management plan and other Oceans Act MPA program guidance and policies.

Partenariat avec les communautés pour améliorer la sécurité maritime dans l’Arctique.

Légende : Rankin Inlet, Nunavut

Ed Zebedee, conseiller spécial du sous-ministre, gouvernement du Nunavut : Je suis vraiment heureux de voir la Garde côtière auxiliaire s’étendre à tout le Nunavut. Ils viennent de l’Arctique et ont des liens dans l’Arctique et comprennent les gens dans les endroits et c’est vraiment important et cela fait aussi une grande différence pour les gens dans la communauté, car il y a des gens qui les aident. Je pense que cela aura un grand impact, surtout entre Jane et Churchill.

Peter Garapick, surintendant de la recherche et du sauvetage dans l’Arctique, Garde côtière canadienne : C’est tout simplement phénoménal ce que nous pouvons faire, les changements que nous pouvons apporter et les impacts que nous pouvons avoir dans les petites communautés isolées et ce sont elles qui parlent à leurs amis, leurs voisins et leurs collègues.

Tony Dias, chef d’unité, Garde côtière canadienne, RankinInlet : Il y a beaucoup de bateaux ici, il y a toujours du trafic maritime entre les navires et tous ceux qui partent à la chasse pour une autre victoire. Nous pouvons intervenir ici en un instant si quelqu’un tombe en panne là-bas, vous voulez être en mesure d’aller le chercher rapidement.

66,2022-03-04,Ce que nous avons entendu : l’avenir du Plan de protection des océans,https://tc.canada.ca/fr/services-generaux/consultations/ce-que-nous-avons-entendu-avenir-plan-protection-oceans,0,0,0,0,tc.canada.ca,Canada,"Lancé en novembre 2016, le Plan de protection des océans permet au gouvernement du Canada de travailler avec les Canadiens et les peuples autochtones pour protéger nos côtes et nos voies navigables pour les générations futures.

Grâce au Plan de protection des océans :

le transport maritime est plus sécuritaire au Canada;

les espèces marines du Canada sont mieux protégées;

le Canada a amélioré sa capacité de prévenir les incidents maritimes et d’y intervenir;

les communautés autochtones ont davantage leur mot à dire sur la façon dont leurs côtes et leurs voies navigables traditionnelles sont gérées.

Ces progrès sont le fruit d’une collaboration avec les peuples autochtones, les communautés côtières, l’industrie maritime et le milieu universitaire. En travaillant ensemble, nous veillerons à ce que la sécurité maritime et la protection du secteur maritime du Canada soient de calibre mondial et répondent aux attentes des Canadiens.

Au cours des cinq dernières années, des événements (forums de dialogue, discussions avec les responsables de programme, structures de gouvernance officielles et consultations en ligne), des partenaires et des représentants ont contribué à façonner le Plan de protection des océans.

À la fin de la première phase du plan, nous devons continuer d’assurer la sécurité du transport maritime et de protéger l’environnement pour les générations futures. Le renouvellement du Plan de protection des océans nous permettra de nous appuyer sur les résultats antérieurs et de nous concentrer sur de nouveaux domaines.

En juin et en juillet 2021, le gouvernement du Canada a lancé des consultations en personne dans le cadre de son engagement à faire participer les peuples autochtones et d’autres représentants du secteur maritime à l’élaboration de la prochaine phase du Plan de protection des océans.

Sur cette page

Notre approche de consultation

Avant de consulter les partenaires et les représentants, nous avons examiné les commentaires collectifs recueillis lors de la mobilisation menée dans le cadre du Plan de protection des océans au cours des quatre dernières années. Cela nous a aidés à comprendre les priorités de nos partenaires autochtones et des représentants du secteur maritime pour la prochaine phase du Plan de protection des océans. Après avoir examiné tous les renseignements recueillis, nous avons constaté que les commentaires portaient sur trois domaines prioritaires :

prévention, intervention et rétablissement; technologie, données probantes et protection des écosystèmes; inclusion et transparence.

Nous avons eu des réunions virtuelles avec divers ordres de gouvernement, des groupes autochtones et des représentants du secteur maritime. Certaines de ces réunions ont été organisées ou dirigées par Transports Canada, tandis que d’autres ont été organisées par Pêches et Océans Canada ou la Garde côtière canadienne.

Les réunions ont été structurées de manière à recueillir des commentaires, et les participants ont été invités à demander des réunions de suivi ou à présenter des observations écrites s’ils voulaient fournir plus de commentaires.

Les participants ont répondu aux questions suivantes :

Les trois domaines prioritaires qui ont été déterminés sont-ils importants pour vous? Veuillez expliquer votre réponse.

Aimeriez-vous ajouter de l’information à l’un ou l’autre de ces domaines prioritaires pour les rendre plus pertinents pour votre région ou votre situation?

Y a-t-il d’autres domaines prioritaires qui devraient être abordés dans le cadre du thème respectif?

Du 1er juin au 31 juillet 2021, il y a eu plus de 40 conversations avec des partenaires et des représentants de partout au Canada. Plus de 450 commentaires et questions uniques ont été recueillis et notés lors des réunions ou des présentations écrites qui ont suivi.

Plus de 60 organisations ont participé à des réunions ou ont présenté des observations écrites. La plupart (59 %) étaient des organisations, des communautés ou des gouvernements autochtones.

Priorités pour la prochaine phase du Plan de protection des océans

Prévention, intervention et rétablissement

Dans le cadre du Plan de protection des océans, nous avons mis en place des mesures visant à améliorer la capacité du système de sécurité maritime à prévenir les incidents maritimes, à s’y préparer et à intervenir. On a demandé aux répondants de formuler des commentaires sur ce domaine prioritaire. Nous étions particulièrement intéressés par les commentaires sur ce qui suit :

l’amélioration de la communication pendant un incident de sécurité maritime;

la façon dont les communautés locales pourraient participer davantage aux interventions en cas d’incidents de sécurité maritime (comme un déversement de navire, la surveillance, une collision, etc.);

la gestion des risques d’interactions entre les grands et les petits navires.

Points clés soulevés

La plupart des commentaires portaient sur l’efficacité des programmes et des systèmes actuels pour une intervention en cas de déversement ou d’incident maritime. La majorité des commentaires suggéraient qu’une approche globale bien financée, assortie d’une communication plus claire et plus rapide pour intervenir en cas d’incident de sécurité maritime, pourrait réduire au minimum les dommages et les répercussions connexes.

Tous les répondants étaient préoccupés par l’augmentation du volume du trafic, la nature changeante des navires (autrement dit, un plus grand nombre de bateaux de plaisance exploités dans le Nord), et le défi que ces changements posent en matière de prévention, d’intervention et de rétablissement pour les incidents de pollution marine.

Pour les répondants du Nord, le manque de clarté quant aux rôles et aux responsabilités des divers acteurs impliqués dans une intervention en cas d’incident maritime, et plus particulièrement quant à la façon dont ces acteurs travaillent ensemble lors d’un incident maritime, rend les communautés du Nord vulnérables. D’autres aspects du système de sécurité maritime qui exacerbent parfois les difficultés dans le Nord comprennent le recours à des systèmes de communication désuets et inefficaces, ainsi qu’un accès inadéquat aux outils, à l’équipement et aux ressources fondamentaux qui doivent être utilisés pour mener une intervention efficace.

Sur les côtes est et ouest, les répondants s’inquiétaient des interactions entre les gros et les petits navires (comme les bateaux de pêche), en particulier de la façon dont les navires communiquent entre eux et de la façon dont le trafic est géré.

Domaines d’intérêt proposés

Investir dans les communautés

Les programmes existants qui aident les communautés locales à participer au système de sécurité maritime ont reçu un solide appui, notamment :

l’Initiative de sensibilisation accrue aux activités maritimes, qui donne aux communautés un accès à de l’information en temps réel sur le trafic maritime et les activités maritimes;

le Programme pilote de bénévolat des bateaux communautaires autochtones, qui investit dans la formation, les bateaux et l’équipement afin que les communautés autochtones puissent participer à la recherche et au sauvetage maritimes.

Les répondants ont fait remarquer que cette capacité supplémentaire a permis aux communautés locales de jouer un rôle plus direct en matière de prévention et d’intervention pour des incidents de sécurité maritime dans leurs eaux locales, contribuant ainsi à de meilleurs résultats.

Utiliser l’expertise autochtone pour éclairer les politiques

De nombreux répondants autochtones ont déclaré qu’ils voulaient participer à l’établissement des priorités et à l’élaboration de politiques pour prévenir la pollution marine, s’y préparer et intervenir en cas d’incident.

La compréhension qu’ont les communautés autochtones des dangers pour la navigation locale, des zones marines d’importance culturelle ou archéologique, et d’autres connaissances pourraient aider à mieux comprendre et gérer les répercussions des activités maritimes, et à assurer la sécurité du transport maritime.

Technologie, données probantes et protection des écosystèmes

Le Plan de protection des océans a montré à quel point la technologie est importante pour recueillir les preuves dont nous avons besoin pour protéger les écosystèmes. Cela est essentiel à l’efficacité des mesures de sécurité maritime, ainsi qu’à la préservation et à la restauration des écosystèmes.

On a demandé aux répondants à quel point ils estimaient que ces questions étaient importantes pour la prochaine phase du Plan de protection des océans :

poursuite de la recherche sur les effets cumulatifs des activités de transport maritime;

amélioration de l’accès à des renseignements opportuns et fiables afin d’appuyer une contribution significative à la conservation marine et à la sécurité des déplacements des navires;

intégration des connaissances autochtones et locales à la recherche scientifique pour éclairer les décisions sur la protection des écosystèmes et des zones d’importance culturelle.

Points clés soulevés

La plupart des répondants ont convenu que la protection des océans, pour être efficace, doit tenir compte de l’océan dans son ensemble. Autrement dit, nous devrions utiliser une approche écosystémique. Les approches axées sur des questions isolées ne sont pas très efficaces.

Les répondants ont fortement appuyé l’utilisation de technologies pour accroître notre sensibilisation et notre compréhension de l’incidence du trafic maritime sur l’environnement, en particulier les effets croissants du transport maritime.

De nombreux répondants ont appuyé des programmes qui rétablissent l’état initial des écosystèmes, comme le Fonds pour la restauration côtière et le Programme d’élimination des épaves et des navires abandonnés.

Domaines d’intérêt proposés

Combler les lacunes statistiques

Les commentaires ont montré qu’il est nécessaire d’améliorer la façon dont nous recueillons, échangeons et analysons les données – y compris les données historiques et de référence – qui peuvent nous aider à protéger et à restaurer les écosystèmes marins sensibles.

Une bonne partie de ces travaux ont commencé dans le cadre de projets du Plan de protection des océans, comme le Programme sur les données environnementales côtières de référence et l’Initiative d’évaluation des effets cumulatifs du transport maritime. Mais il reste encore beaucoup à faire, et ce travail devrait être appuyé et étendu à d’autres régions géographiques à l’avenir.

Utiliser de nouvelles technologies

L’utilisation des dernières technologies de communication pourrait nous aider à mieux comprendre et à mieux échanger l’information en temps réel avec nos partenaires maritimes. Les domaines à développer en priorité sont les suivants :

collaborer avec nos partenaires pour gérer le trafic maritime;

utiliser des technologies qui réduisent la menace du bruit sous-marin des navires pour les mammifères marins vulnérables;

créer un environnement propice à une décarbonisation efficace et à la réduction de la pollution provenant du réseau de transport maritime.

Inclure l’expertise autochtone pour améliorer notre base de données probantes

De nombreux répondants autochtones veulent que l’expertise et les points de vue autochtones soient utilisés pour améliorer la base de données probantes.

Le savoir autochtone est enraciné dans une compréhension approfondie des océans et des voies navigables, et offre des données probantes précieuses pour appuyer les programmes et les décisions qui protègent les écosystèmes marins.

Les répondants ont signalé que tout travail visant à inclure les connaissances autochtones doit tenir compte des questions de protection et transparence des renseignements personnels associées à l’accès, et veiller à ce que les connaissances autochtones soient soigneusement consignées et gérées.

Inclusion et transparence

Les progrès que nous avons réalisés dans le cadre du Plan de protection des océans sont le résultat direct de notre collaboration avec les peuples autochtones, les communautés côtières, l’industrie maritime et le milieu universitaire. Bien que nous ayons travaillé avec ces partenaires pour appuyer la sécurité maritime et protéger les écosystèmes côtiers, il reste beaucoup de travail à faire avant d’atteindre nos objectifs.

On a demandé aux répondants dans quelle mesure ils trouvaient ces sujets pertinents et quelles étaient les priorités qui, selon eux, devaient être abordées dans la prochaine phase du Plan de protection des océans. Ils ont soulevé les points suivants :

Soutenir la capacité de participation des peuples autochtones et des représentants;

Prévoir plus de temps et d’espace pour une mobilisation significative, y compris entre les partenaires et les représentants;

Créer une meilleure boucle de rétroaction pour tenir compte de l’information recueillie grâce à la mobilisation et éclairer les prochaines étapes;

Créer plus d’occasions de collaboration et de solutions consensuelles (comme l’initiative de sensibilisation accrue aux activités maritimes, une gestion proactive des navires, etc.).

Points clés

Bien que de nombreux répondants soient d’accord que le Plan de protection des océans tient compte de l’expertise et de l’expérience des Autochtones, la plupart ont convenu qu’il reste du travail à faire pour s’assurer que les partenaires autochtones participent à la conception et à la mise en œuvre des politiques et des programmes.

Fait à noter, les répondants étaient d’avis que la structure de financement actuelle qui appuie la participation des Autochtones aux programmes du Plan de protection des océans n’est pas suffisante. Ils estimaient que le financement ne répondait pas aux besoins des communautés et ne les aiderait pas à atteindre les objectifs du plan. Par exemple, les exigences relatives à la présentation d’une demande, à la gestion et à la coordination du financement imposent une lourde charge de travail aux communautés dont les ressources sont fixes et limitées. Par conséquent, les communautés ont souvent besoin d’une aide supplémentaire pour s’acquitter de la charge de travail liée à l’obtention de fonds fédéraux.

La pression exercée sur les ressources administratives est plus grande lorsque les communautés participent à de multiples programmes fédéraux dirigés par différents ministères ou organismes. De plus, les critères de financement sont souvent trop stricts et peuvent amener les communautés à chercher des programmes pour financer l’ensemble d’un projet. Cela complique à son tour les exigences en matière de rapports et la capacité de la communauté de s’assurer qu’un financement suffisant est obtenu.

Enfin, les répondants ont souligné l’écart entre le financement à court terme du Plan de protection des océans (3 à 5 ans) et les longs échéanciers (5 ans et plus) pour les projets que les communautés et le plan tentent d’établir. La capacité de la communauté de planifier, de former et de gérer les ressources est affectée lorsque le financement n’est pas assuré pour l’ensemble de l’échéancier d’un projet. Cela peut avoir une incidence sur le succès des partenariats à long terme.

Les représentants de l’industrie ont également signalé que leur industrie a une capacité limitée d’aider à former et à instruire de nouvelles personnes, et qu’ils auront besoin de ressources pour former les marins existants avant les pénuries prévues en raison du vieillissement de la main-d’œuvre.

Les participants autochtones ont souligné que l’initiative de sensibilisation accrue aux activités maritimes consistait en une « réconciliation en action » en raison de son approche collaborative. Les répondants ont indiqué qu’ils aimeraient que des approches semblables soient utilisées dans les futurs programmes du Plan de protection des océans.

Domaines d’intérêt proposés

Renforcer les capacités et offrir d’autres soutiens

Les participants autochtones ont souligné que le Plan de protection des océans a créé plus d’occasions pour que les peuples autochtones participent à la sécurité maritime. Un financement stable à long terme du plan est maintenant nécessaire pour permettre de poursuivre ce travail à long terme.

La capacité de participation de nos partenaires autochtones activement à la conception, à l’élaboration et à la mise en œuvre de mesures de sécurité maritime et de protection des écosystèmes varie grandement entre les régions et les partenaires. Selon la nature de leur implication, nous avons besoin d’un soutien continu pour renforcer la capacité de participation de nos partenaires autochtones. Cela pourrait comprendre ce qui suit :

Obtenir les ressources humaines et financières dont les partenaires autochtones ont besoin pour participer activement aux projets fédéraux qui ont une incidence directe sur leur bien-être ou aux projets qui requièrent leur expertise;

Veiller à ce que les partenaires autochtones aient l’information et les compétences dont ils ont besoin pour répondre aux exigences du gouvernement (comme les demandes de financement et les exigences en matière de rapports);

Obtenir les outils et les fournitures dont ils ont besoin pour s’acquitter de leurs rôles et responsabilités essentiels;

Donner accès aux partenaires autochtones à des structures décisionnelles et à des forums qui influencent et façonnent les programmes maritimes fédéraux.

Élargir les modèles de partenariat existants

Les répondants autochtones ont souligné que les modèles de partenariat existants établis dans le cadre du Plan de protection des océans pourraient servir de modèles pour d’autres ententes de gouvernance avec le gouvernement fédéral. Par exemple, l’entente-cadre de réconciliation conclue entre le gouvernement du Canada et 14 Premières Nations de la côte nord a permis à des partenaires de s’attaquer à des problèmes maritimes critiques au moyen d’une structure de gouvernance établie.

Améliorer la coordination fédérale

Tous les répondants régionaux veulent que les ministères fédéraux qui participent au Plan de protection des océans travaillent ensemble pour créer une mobilisation meilleure et plus uniforme. Lorsqu’un grand nombre d’organismes, de ministères et d’organisations travaillent tous sur la même question qui touche une communauté, mais selon des perspectives, des mandats et des exigences qui diffèrent, cela exerce des pressions considérables sur les petites communautés aux ressources limitées. Les répondants étaient d’avis qu’une coordination améliorée et à grande échelle réduirait la charge de travail liée à la participation à ces événements et limiterait la fatigue liée à la mobilisation.

Aperçus régionaux

Cette section donne un aperçu des points de vue régionaux sur les questions prioritaires, le transport maritime et la protection des océans.

Région de l’Atlantique

Au Canada atlantique, les commentaires portaient sur les initiatives du Plan de protection des océans suivantes :

Points clés

Les partenaires et les représentants étaient d’avis que le Plan de protection des océans n’était pas conçu pour répondre aux besoins du Canada atlantique. À l’avenir, ils veulent que la prochaine phase du plan soutienne des relations stables et significatives, et qu’il y ait des occasions de faire participer les jeunes Autochtones à la protection des océans et des marins.

Les participants de l’Atlantique étaient également d’avis que la prise en compte des connaissances et de l’expertise autochtones est une prochaine étape essentielle pour améliorer la façon dont nous protégeons le milieu marin. L’initiative d’évaluation des effets cumulatifs du transport maritime a été mentionnée comme modèle possible qui pourrait être élargi. Les participants démontraient également un intérêt à inclure les questions de sécurité des bateaux de pêche et des embarcations de plaisance, ainsi que les questions de sécurité du transport maritime.

Région du Saint-Laurent et des Grands Lacs

Dans la région du Saint-Laurent et des Grands Lacs, les commentaires portaient sur les initiatives du Plan de protection des océans suivantes :

Points clés

Les répondants étaient préoccupés par l’augmentation du volume et de la taille des navires dans cette région, surtout par leur incidence sur les petits navires locaux. Ils ont également souligné que la navigation dans les eaux terrestres présente des défis qui lui sont propres et qu’elle est très différente de la navigation en haute mer. Les répondants veulent que les communautés locales jouent un plus grand rôle et disposent de meilleures ressources (p. ex., équipement et formation) afin de pouvoir intervenir en cas d’incidents de sécurité maritime.

Les participants de toutes les régions ont souligné que les programmes maritimes fédéraux doivent :

mieux coordonner les programmes maritimes fédéraux existants en dehors du Plan de protection des océans;

mieux coordonner la collecte des données;

améliorer le travail avec les provinces et les territoires;

mieux utiliser les plateformes actuelles pour les projets existants.

Enfin, les effets cumulatifs du transport maritime le long du Saint-Laurent étaient une grande préoccupation. De nombreux participants étaient d’avis qu’il faut appuyer davantage les projets qui examinent les effets du transport maritime sur les écosystèmes et la façon dont ces effets peuvent être gérés.

Région de l’Arctique – Inuit Nunangat

Dans l’ensemble de la région de l’Inuit Nunangat (le territoire traditionnel des Inuits, qui comprend le Nunavut, le nord du Québec, le nord du Labrador et le nord des Territoires du Nord-Ouest), les commentaires portaient sur les initiatives du Plan de protection des océans :

Points clés

Les répondants ont souligné l’importance d’appliquer une approche « fondée sur les distinctions » lors du travail avec les peuples autochtones. Une telle approche met en évidence les besoins et les défis uniques des personnes vivant dans le nord par rapport au sud du Canada.

Les priorités, les politiques ou les programmes qui touchent le Nord devraient être fondés sur l’expérience, l’expertise et les connaissances des Inuits.

Les répondants ont également souligné la nécessité d’améliorer la capacité de la région en matière :

de recherche et de sauvetage;

d’intervention en cas d’incidents maritimes (en finançant les navires, l’équipement, la formation, etc.);

de coordination partout dans la région.

Les participants étaient d’avis que les résultats pour les Inuits pourraient être meilleurs si les gouvernements et les représentants parvenaient à mieux coordonner leurs efforts avant que des changements de politique ou de réglementation ne se produisent, et à mieux communiquer comment ces changements pourraient avoir une incidence sur les communautés locales.

Un meilleur accès aux outils de gestion du trafic permettra aux communautés locales de mieux connaître le trafic maritime à proximité et d’éclairer la prise de décisions locales sur les questions maritimes.

Les répondants du Nunavik (le territoire traditionnel des Inuits dans le nord du Québec) étaient préoccupés par le fait qu’ils n’avaient pas participé adéquatement aux consultations et aux plans des initiatives du Plan de protection des océans. Ils veulent avoir plus de chances d’échanger des idées sur les questions maritimes avec des représentants du gouvernement, de l’industrie maritime et d’autres utilisateurs.

Région du Pacifique

Dans la région du Pacifique, les partenaires et les représentants ont participé à un plus large éventail d’initiatives du Plan de protection des océans comparativement à d’autres régions, et les participants ne se sont pas toujours concentrés sur des initiatives en particulier. Cela reflète peut-être le vaste niveau de mobilisation qui a eu lieu dans cette région comparativement à d’autres depuis le lancement du Plan de protection des océans.

Les initiatives fréquemment citées comprennent :

Questions clés

Les répondants ont souligné qu’il est important de comprendre les protocoles culturels, les besoins et les intérêts locaux afin de mettre en œuvre un programme avec succès et d’atteindre les résultats souhaités. La capacité des peuples autochtones de participer au système de sécurité maritime est une priorité absolue.

Cela comprend :

le renforcement et le maintien de la capacité institutionnelle à long terme;

l’offre d’un accès à un financement soutenu avec une faible charge de travail;

la gestion des pertes potentielles en raison des changements de personnel;

le soutien accru à l’élaboration conjointe ou à la cogestion avec des partenaires dans le cadre d’un plus grand nombre de projets et d’initiatives.

Des travaux continus sont nécessaires pour réduire les obstacles à l’entrée dans l’industrie maritime.

Les répondants étaient d’avis que nous avons besoin d’une meilleure compréhension des effets cumulatifs du transport maritime, qui comprend l’expertise et l’expérience des peuples autochtones, afin de mieux éclairer les décisions. Cela englobe la compréhension des répercussions du transport maritime sur les écosystèmes marins et d’autres écosystèmes à proximité (comme la terre, l’air, les eaux intérieures, etc.).

Ils veulent également que le gouvernement du Canada travaille davantage avec les communautés et les dirigeants autochtones pour déterminer comment intégrer leur expertise et leur expérience dans les processus décisionnels. Les répondants veulent avoir accès à des renseignements et à des données plus à jour, en particulier des données de référence, puisqu’elles ont trait à la sécurité maritime et à la protection des écosystèmes.

De nombreux répondants étaient d’avis qu’il faut davantage de projets qui mettent l’accent sur la prévention et le rétablissement des accidents maritimes, et non seulement sur l’intervention. Ils veulent que les incidents soient mieux communiqués et signalés aux partenaires, et ils veulent aider à renforcer la capacité de leurs communautés à intervenir en cas d’incident et à appliquer les règlements de sécurité maritime.

En ce qui concerne la prochaine phase du Plan de protection des océans, les répondants étaient d’avis que les structures en place en vertu des ententes existantes doivent être mieux utilisées pour permettre aux partenaires autochtones de contribuer directement aux programmes futurs.

Les communautés autochtones et côtières veulent également que les ministères fédéraux travaillent davantage ensemble. Une meilleure collaboration entre ministères fédéraux aidera ces communautés à participer de manière plus efficace et à atteindre de meilleurs résultats.

Conclusion et prochaines étapes

Les principales constatations découlant de cet engagement à l’échelle régionale et nationale ont été utiles pour clarifier davantage les priorités globales des partenaires et des représentants de partout au Canada en matière de protection des océans pour l’avenir.

Au moment où le gouvernement fédéral se penche sur la prochaine phase du Plan de protection des océans, ces constatations serviront à façonner les changements possibles aux politiques, aux programmes, aux lois et aux règlements.

De plus, à mesure qu’on en saura davantage sur ce à quoi pourrait ressembler la prochaine phase, le gouvernement fédéral continuera de s’engager auprès des partenaires et des représentants du Plan de protection des océans afin de collaborer à l’établissement des priorités, à la conception et à la mise en œuvre des initiatives et des projets à venir.

71,2022-04-20,Grave impacto generan plantas desalinizadoras: Instan a aplicar medidas urgentes para la protección del océano,https://www.elciudadano.com/actualidad/instan-a-aplicar-medidas-de-proteccion-del-oceano-ante-los-graves-danos-que-generan-las-plantas-desalinizadoras-al-medio-ambiente/04/20/,789,778,11,0,elciudadano.com,Chile,"Organizaciones medioambientalistas y expertos en biología marina instan a aplicar medidas para la conservación y protección de los océanos y de las especies que habitan en ella, ante los graves daños que están generando las plantas desalinizadoras al medio ambiente.

Las plantas desalinizadoras se han utilizado en Chile como una medida para combatir la actual sequía que está afectando al país. Estas industria, se ha posicionado como la mejor solución para poder afrontar la escasez hídrica, que mantiene a varios municipios en estado de alerta.

No obstante, hasta la fecha, no se ha evaluado como la industria de la extracción del agua de mar puede producir efectos a la biodiversidad marina, refiere un artículo de opinión de LaRadiodelSur.

Por ejemplo, el año pasado se inauguró en la región de Atacama, la primera planta desalinizadora estatal de agua potable, con el fin de garantizar agua a más de 220.000 personas, no obstante; los procesos que se usan con la expulsión de residuos – tras el procesamiento del agua – genera un fuerte impacto en el fondo marino.

En total, Chile cuenta con 23 plantas desalinizadoras, de las cuales 14 son usadas por la industria y la minería.

Para la bióloga marina y miembro de la Fundación Terram, Elizabeth Soto; el método utilizado puede atrapar a los organismos marinos, hasta causarles la muerte.

“Los organismos marinos pueden ser arrastrados, atrapados o incluso morir; pueden lesionarse o debilitarse; dependiendo de la especie, fase de crecimiento y etapa del ciclo de vida; conllevando a efectos potenciales sobre la pérdida de abundancia y diversidad, así como cambios en la distribución relativa de los organismos en el ambiente afectado”, argumenta Soto, citada en el artículo de opinión.

Los residuos que expulsa las plantas desaladoras contienen químicos tóxicos para el medio ambiente. Es más, un estudio realizado por la Universidad de Naciones Unidas (UNU), señaló que la salmuera estaba compuesta por 5% de sal con toxinas como cloro y cobre, un 1,5% más de lo que contiene un agua marina común.

“​​El océano está sometido a numerosos factores estresantes, derivados de un uso abusivo por parte de los seres humanos, y de ser instaladas indiscriminadamente y sin los adecuados cuidados, las plantas desaladoras podrían sumar a deteriorar aún más la salud de los ecosistemas marinos, de los organismos que viven en ellos y de los procesos oceánicos que permiten la vida en la Tierra”, recalcó la bióloga de la Fundación.

No solo el medio ambiente: La pesca artesanal también corre peligro

Considerar que la desalinización del agua es la única solución para la escasez hídrica, pone en alerta a diferentes organizaciones, debido a que también afecta a la pesca artesanal.

Para la directora ejecutiva de la ONG Ocean Chile, Liesbeth Van Der Meer; estos métodos acaban con las especies y podría afectar la pesca artesanal, por lo que es necesario realizar un «catastro acabado de las zonas donde existen corrientes circulares» para evitar que se originen salmuera.

“Un ejemplo emblemático es lo que ocurre en Mejillones donde, hoy en día, el mar tiene un color característico de tono turquesa. Ello ocurre porque no hay surgencia: el agua es cristalina, sin vida y eso es lo que nos preocupa a nosotros sobre lo que pueda pasar con la pesca artesanal. Se perdieron las especies y, es básicamente la devolución de la salmuera, lo que hace estos ecosistemas estériles”, explica la directora de la ONG, citada por LaReddelSur.

“Hay que pensar que la vida marina se encuentra principalmente dentro de las primeras diez millas, es ahí donde se reclutan los peces y donde viven su vida juvenil, por lo que si alteras ese espacio, después no vas a tener pesquerías sustentables en alta mar. Hay que entender que esto es un ecosistema en que la afectación va a ser en su totalidad y no solamente en el punto donde se produzca la descarga de salmuera”, añadió.

Ante esta situación, se está trabajando en un proyecto para que las decisiones que se tomen con respecto a las plantas desalinizadoras sean aprobadas tras investigaciones científicas.

“La propuesta, es que hay que incluir a la ciencia para que la actividad sea sostenible socio ecológicamente: desde el punto de vista del consumo humano, la actividad productiva y la ecología. La idea, es justamente guiar un poco la toma de decisiones, la política pública, basándonos en evidencias científicas, para ver dónde es más idóneo o no este tipo de plantas”, puntualizó el investigador del Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas (CEAZA) de la Región de Coquimbo, Víctor Aguilera.

Para Aguilera, es importante que todas las actividades que del ser humano y que tengan interacción con el medio ambiente, deben ser evaluadas, para que este no se vea afectado.",es,"Mejillones, Atacama, Chile","la Región de Coquimbo, CEAZA, UNU, la Fundación Terram, LaRadiodelSur, Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Zonas Áridas, la Fundación, LaReddelSur., ONG, la Universidad de Naciones Unidas","Víctor Aguilera, Liesbeth Van der meer, Elizabeth Soto","plantas, agua, lo, marina, ambiente, vida, organismos, salmuera, pesca, artesanal"

«Hoy nos comprometemos a proteger nuestros océanos. Hay algunos que piensan que países que todavía no somos desarrollados y que nos falta para avanzar, tenemos que esperar para subirnos al carro de las energías limpias y la protección del medioambiente», añadió.

Durante el encuentro, Boric señaló que la crisis climática es una situación que no conoce fronteras, por lo que es necesario realizar acciones concretas para avanzar y frenar el flagelo contra el planeta.

«El mundo necesita a América unida, tenemos que volver a conversar sobre los temas que nos unen, no solamente sobre aquellos que nos dividen y la protección del medioambiente, del desarrollo sustentable y equitativo en sin duda uno de ellos, así que esta iniciativa me alegra mucho», puntualizó.

Recalcó que la crisis medioambiental es una postura firme en su Gobierno y aseveró que, este primer paso tiene como objetivo enfrentar las grandes crisis que hoy afecta al mundo.

«Nosotros venimos a decir que tenemos que liderar este proceso y desde América estamos hoy planteando esta iniciativa para la protección de los océanos con el objetivo de enfrentar las tres grandes crisis que hoy afectan al mundo: el cambio climático, la pérdida de biodiversidad y el deterioro del océano», dijo, citado por El Desconcierto.",es,"China, Ecuador, Costa Rica, América unida, Perú, Estados Unidos, Canadá, Panamá, EE.UU, Los Ángeles, París, Rusia, México, India","El Desconcierto, Presidencia de Chile, Coalición ""América por la Protección del Océano, la Unión Europea, MegaNoticias","Gabriel Boric, @gabrielboric Encabeza","protección, océano, boric, países, américa, crisis, acuerdo, coalición, objetivo, océanos"

El objetivo de estos espacios es generar corredores marinos conectados ecológicamente en la región protegiendo los hábitats esenciales y las rutas migratorias a escala regional.

La iniciativa fue impulsada por Chile y firmada por Panamá, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Perú, Canadá, México y EEUU, y participaron de la instancia los presidentes Gabriel Boric; Laurentino Cortizo (Panamá); Rodrigo Chaves (Costa Rica), Pedro Castillo (Perú), el secretario de Relaciones Exteriores de México, Marcelo Ebrard; la ministra de Asuntos Exteriores de Canadá, Mélanie Joly; y el enviado presidencial especial de Estados Unidos para el Clima, John Kerry.

Sobre la importancia de la coalición, el Presidente Boric señaló que ""esta iniciativa tiene el objetivo de enfrentar las tres grandes crisis que hoy día afectan al mundo: el cambio climático, la pérdida de biodiversidad y el deterioro del océano""

""Si somos capaces de utilizar nuestros liderazgos para proteger lo que es de toda la humanidad, vamos a contribuir de manera decidida y decirle a los países desarrollados que tienen el deber de hacer más esfuerzos para proteger el medio ambiente. El mundo necesita a América unida; tenemos que volver a conversar sobre los temas que nos unen y la protección del medio ambiente es uno de ellos"", añadió el mandatario.

Esta coalición sigue la línea de la ya anunciada política exterior ""turquesa"" del gobierno del Presidente Boric, la cual sintetiza el color verde, por el cuidado del medio ambiente, y el color azul, por la protección de los océanos, que ""representa el compromiso del gobierno en proteger y conservar nuestros recursos"", publicó en Twitter el mandatario.

La directora de Oceana, Liesbeth van der Meer, indicó a DF en una nota anterior, que “estos corredores conectan ecosistemas, hábitats y especies que por allí se desplazan, muchos de los cuales trascienden los límites geográficos de los países.

Este 23 de marzo, el gobierno del presidente Gabriel Boric recibe su primer Día Meteorológico Mundial, que año a año conmemora la creación de la Organización Meteorológica Mundial (OMM) planteando una reflexión sobre la crisis climática global. Lo hace en buen momento, tras la esperada firma del Acuerdo de Escazú y con la intención declarada de abordar la crisis climática con mayor transversalidad en los distintos sectores públicos, como fue anunciado en su discurso inaugural.

El tema planteado por la OMM para este año es “Alerta temprana y Acción temprana”, que aparece como una discusión necesaria, sobre todo ante los alarmantes hallazgos publicados por el Panel Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (IPCC por sus siglas en inglés) en su informe más reciente (1).

El énfasis que ese informe pone en la adaptación permite comentar sobre las oportunidades del nuevo gobierno para implementar la acción temprana a través de medidas de adaptación basadas en ecosistemas en un sector de particular importancia: el océano.

El océano es el principal regulador climático del planeta. Se calcula que ha absorbido entre el 20 y 30% de las emisiones antropogénicas de carbono y el 90% del exceso de calor en la atmósfera (2). Esta función crucial está bajo amenaza por el propio cambio climático —debido a la creciente acidificación— y por otros impactos, entre ellos los de la contaminación directa del océano, la industria extractiva de la pesca, la acuicultura y la minería submarina, por mencionar algunas.

Chile ha sido consciente de la importancia del océano. De hecho, en 2021, llegó a proteger un 88,76% de áreas marinas, sobre los 18 millones de hectáreas totales del sistema nacional de áreas protegidas del Estado. Sin embargo, el escaso financiamiento disponible para esas áreas es una primera alerta roja: el presupuesto para áreas marinas en 2021 fue de $432.200.000, el 2.39% del total del presupuesto para áreas protegidas y equivalente más o menos a $3 pesos por hectárea.

En paralelo, el Estado ha impulsado una serie de programas de transferencias públicas para beneficio de la salmonicultura, una de las actividades que más impacto ha causado en el mar en las últimas décadas. Desde la Corporación de Fomento de la Producción (CORFO), destacan el Consorcio Tecnológico para la Acuicultura Oceánica y el Programa Estratégico Mesoregional Salmón más Sustentable, que han destinado más de $4.500.000.000 para el mejoramiento del rendimiento económico del salmón sin considerar oportunidades de mejora de su desempeño ambiental.

El caso más alarmante es el de la Ley Navarino, que se planteó fomentar el poblamiento y desarrollo productivo de algunas zonas aisladas de la Región de Magallanes. La única empresa salmonera que opera dentro del área beneficiada es Nova Austral, que ha recibido más de la mitad del total de los subsidios otorgados durante la vigencia de la Ley y que solo durante 2021 recibió $9.356.868.649.

La gravedad de este caso no termina ahí. Los centros salmoneros que se benefician con este subsidio se ubican en el interior del Parque Nacional Alberto de Agostini y han afectado gravemente sus ecosistemas (3). De hecho, la compañía actualmente enfrenta un juicio penal precisamente por fraude a la normativa ambiental para la obtención de los subsidios de Ley Navarino (4).

Salmoneras – Gentileza Fundación Terram (3)

La acción temprana que recomienda el IPCC, en el caso del océano chileno, requiere, como mínimo, partir de un análisis de la efectividad de los mecanismos de protección actualmente vigentes. El gasto exiguo destinado a proteger las áreas marinas no parece ser una inversión pública eficiente, mientras se financia fuertemente la expansión de una industria que tiene el efecto exactamente contrario. En rigor, e incluso considerando las multas cursadas al sector por infracciones ambientales (5), las cifras demuestran que el Estado de Chile ha favorecido más la producción de impactos ambientales en el mar (muchas veces irreparables), que la gestión de las áreas protegidas marinas.

La tendencia internacional en materia de subsidios es hacia la prohibición de aquellos que tienen un efecto negativo sobre los recursos naturales y su recuperación.

Una política pública interna coherente con dicha tendencia y con la imperiosa necesidad de implementar medidas de adaptación basadas en ecosistemas debiera apuntar hacia la instauración de incentivos que promuevan la conservación y recuperación de los recursos pesqueros y acuícolas, así como al mejoramiento del nivel económico de las comunidades costeras.

La iniciativa tiene por objetivo establecer una red de áreas marinas protegidas ecológicamente interconectadas que abarque desde Canadá hasta Chile, detalló la Cancillería chilena.

Nueve países del continente americano, con salida al Pacífico, conformaron la coalición 'Américas por la Protección del Océano', una iniciativa presentada por el presidente de Chile, Gabriel Boric.

""Desde América estamos hoy día planteando esta iniciativa para la protección de los océanos con el objetivo de enfrentar las tres grandes crisis que hoy día afectan al mundo: el cambio climático, la pérdida de la biodiversidad y el deterioro los océanos"", dijo Boric.

El lanzamiento de esta coalición se dio en un evento paralelo a la IX Cumbre de las Américas, en el Hotel Intercontinental de Los Ángeles, California (EE.UU.).

A Boric se sumaron y firmaron el plan sus homólogos de Colombia, Iván Duque; Perú, Pedro Castillo; Ecuador, Guillermo Lasso; Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves; y Panamá, Laurentino Cortizo.

También suscribieron el acuerdo los cancilleres de Canadá, Mélanie Joly, y de México, Marcelo Ebrard; así como el encargado de asuntos de clima de EE.UU., John Kerry.

""Desde Chile agradecemos la generosidad con la que nuestros países hermanos se suman a esta iniciativa. Acá no se trata de protagonismos: se trata de que podamos contribuir con un grano de arena para mejorar la calidad de vida de nuestros habitantes"", comentó Boric.

""Lucha por la supervivencia""

De acuerdo con el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Chile, con esta coalición se busca coordinar acciones entre países que comparten salida al océano Pacífico para contribuir a la protección y sostenibilidad de los ecosistemas.

Asimismo, señala que la iniciativa tiene por objetivo establecer una red de áreas marinas protegidas ecológicamente interconectadas que abarque desde Canadá hasta Chile.

En el lanzamiento de la coalición, Boric dijo que esta iniciativa ""es una lucha por la supervivencia"", porque los océanos ""son los principales sumideros de carbono y tienen un papel crucial frente a los efectos del cambio climático"".

Castillo, por su parte, dijo que la defensa de los océanos no debe quedarse en la firma de este documento. ""Hay que estructurar una agenda de trabajo en conjunto. No debe ser únicamente una tarea del gobierno, se debe establecer un currículo educativo en Latinoamérica para que se geste desde las escuelas su protección y sea espacio de debate en las universidades y movimientos populares; dialoguemos para que las familias cultiven el cuidado a los océanos en medio de una cultura de respeto y explotación racional"", expresó.

""Política turquesa""

""Estamos muy contentos, porque es una iniciativa chilena y los países del Pacífico están acompañándonos, algo que es fundamental dentro de la política turquesa"", expresó la ministra de Exteriores chilena, Antonia Urrejola.

""Turquesa"" es un eje de la actual política exterior chilena, que contempla tanto el cuidado del medioambiente terrestre como de los océanos, señala la Cancillería del país suramericano.

“Hoy es muy buen día para la conservación de los océanos, pero también para la Humanidad”, afirmó en la ceremonia el presidente de Chile, Gabriel Boric, el impulsor de una iniciativa que forma parte de la “diplomacia turquesa” que defiende.



Uno detrás de otro, firmaron el documento Boric, sus colegas de Colombia, Iván Duque; Perú, José Pedro Castillo; Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves; Ecuador, Guillermo Lasso, y Panamá, Laurentino Cortiz, así como los jefes de la diplomacia de Canadá, Mélanie Joly, y de México, Marcelo Ebrard, y el encargado de asuntos de clima de EE.UU., John Kerry.



Iniciativa de Chile en respaldo a los Acuerdos de París



La iniciativa lanzada hoy, afirmó Boric, respaldaba los compromisos asumidos en los Acuerdos de París, y para defenderlos los países signatarios se colocaron “en la primera fila” para cumplirlos.



La idea, agregó el presidente chileno, era amarrar un compromiso “con tres de las grandes crisis que afectan al mundo”, que son el cambio climático, la pérdida de la biodiversidad y el deterioro de los océanos.



“Vamos a trabajar por el establecimiento de una serie de áreas marinas protegidas que van a estar ecológicamente interconectadas, avanzando hacia estrategias regionales para la conservación de los océanos”, manifestó el presidente chileno.



La ONU avisa desde hace décadas del deterioro progresivo de los océanos por problemas viejos, como la pesca sin control, y de otros más recientes, como los microplásticos derivados de la basura que llega a los mares.



Desde que Naciones Unidas comenzó a alertar de este tema, a mediados de la década pasada, ya denunció que cerca de ocho millones de toneladas de plástico llegan cada año a los mares del Planeta y muchos de ellos son consumidos por los peces que alimentan a los humanos.



Pero Duque, a su turno, también alertó sobre otros dos efectos graves del deterioro de los océanos: la destrucción de los arrecifes coralinos y “prácticas tan deleznables como la pesca de arrastre”.



Los nueve instan a China, Rusia, la India o la Unión Europea a unirse



“Los océanos son los principales sumideros naturales de carbono y como tales tienen un papel crucial frente a los efectos del cambio climático”, dijo Boric.



El pacto firmado hoy vincula a los países americanos con la mayor dependencia del Pacífico, pero también es una llamada de atención a otras regiones o países, como China, Rusia, la India o la Unión Europea, citados por Boric, con el fin de que se vinculen a estos mismos esfuerzos.



“Sabemos que la crisis climática no reconoce fronteras, y por eso tenemos que dar pasos concretos”, insistió Boric.

En el marco de la IX Cumbre de las Américas que se desarrolla en Estados Unidos, Chile firmó la creación de “Américas por la Protección del Océano”, coalición que tiene por objetivo establecer una red de áreas marinas protegidas ecológicamente interconectadas que abarque desde Canadá hasta Chile.

De esta manera, se busca coordinar acciones entre países que comparten salida al Océano Pacífico para contribuir a la protección y sostenibilidad de los ecosistemas, así como mejorar la gobernanza en áreas marinas protegidas.

Hasta ahí todo marchaba bien. En la ceremonia, el Presidente Gabriel Boric recalcaba que “estamos celebrando el multilateralismo y la oportunidad que el diálogo nos abre para la construcción de un mundo mejor”, añadiendo que “desde el continente americano queremos alzar la voz y lanzar una iniciativa en la que ojalá se sumen más países, porque somos altamente vulnerables a la crisis del cambio climático”.

Sin embargo, en medio de su intervención, el Mandatario señalaría que “si somos capaces de utilizar nuestro liderazgo para proteger lo que es de toda la humanidad, porque esto no se trata solo de nuestros países, sino que de toda la humanidad, vamos a estar contribuyendo de manera decida y le vamos a poder decir con más propiedad a los países desarrollados, como Estados Unidos, que no está aquí presente, como la Unión Europea, como China y como India, que tienen el deber de hacer más esfuerzos para proteger nuestro medioambiente. El mundo necesita a América unida. Tenemos que volver a conversar sobre los temas que nos unen, no solo sobre los que nos dividen”.

¿Cuál fue el problema? Que entre los presentes se encontraba el veterano político estadounidense John Kerry, actual Enviado Presidencial Especial de los Estados Unidos para el Clima del gobierno de Joe Biden (y que fuera Secretario de Estado en la administración de Barack Obama).

Peor aún, se encontraba sentado apenas a unos puestos hacia la derecha de nuestro Jefe de Estado.

Según recogió La Tercera, quien reaccionó rápidamente para hacerle ver el incómodo error fue la canciller Antonia Urrejola, que le escribió un mensaje de su puño y letra para alertarlo. El Presidente tuvo que salir rápidamente a autocorregirse señalando: “Disculpa, una pequeña rectificación de mi parte. Yo, cuando hice nuestra mención a los países desarrollados para empujarlos acá, estaba pensando en Europa, China, India, mencioné a Estados Unidos…Estados Unidos está acá presente, con John Kerry. Y eso también es tremendamente importante para nosotros. Canadá y EE.UU. son parte del G7 y no me cabe ninguna duda de que también desde ese liderazgo vamos a poder empujar al resto de los países desarrollados a sumarse a esto”.

Se trató de un pequeño (pero incómodo y preocupante) desaire del Jefe de Estado nacional a uno de los más importantes asesores del Presidente Biden, ad portas de la reunión bilateral que ambos sostendrán en el marco de la Cumbre de las Américas, en Los Ángeles. Y aunque se prevé que no afecte el encuentro, es necesario hacer hincapié en que se trata de otro error de protocolo con autoridades internacionales de especial importancia para nuestro país, recordando lo ocurrido con el Rey de España, Felipe VI, en la ceremonia de cambio de mando presidencial el 11 de marzo pasado en Valparaíso.

Chile y su Política Exterior Turquesa

Volviendo al hecho en el marco del cual se escenificó el traspié del Presidente de la República, cabe destacar que la creación de esta red hemisférica responde al impulso del Gobierno de Chile por una Política Exterior Turquesa, que contempla tanto el cuidado del medio ambiente terrestre, como de los océanos. Así, Chile reafirma su compromiso con el fortalecimiento de la cooperación multilateral en materia ambiental y genera acciones concretas para hacer frente a la crisis climática.

El proyecto, liderado por el Presidente Boric, contó con la firma de Canadá, Estados Unidos, México, Costa Rica, Panamá, Colombia, Ecuador, Perú, además del apoyo de ONGs y actores de la sociedad civil.

“Estamos muy contentos, porque es una iniciativa chilena y los países del Pacífico están acompañándonos, algo que es fundamental dentro de la política turquesa”, destacó por su parte la ministra de Relaciones Exteriores, Antonia Urrejola.

Las áreas marinas protegidas son espacios delimitados reconocidos legalmente para asegurar la preservación de la biodiversidad marina y otorgan múltiples beneficios, como la protección de especies marinas únicas, aumentar las oportunidades de turismo y potenciar el desarrollo sustentable de comunidades costeras.

Cabe destacar que Chile ha apoyado la iniciativa de proteger el 30% del océano en el marco de la Agenda 2030 y ya cuenta con un 43,1% de sus aguas jurisdiccionales bajo alguna categoría de protección, lo que se traduce en 1,3 millones de km2.",es,"China, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Estados Unidos, Perú, Canadá, Colombia, EE.UU., Valparaíso, el Rey de España, Panamá, Chile, Los Ángeles, México, India","Estados Unidos, Gobierno de Chile, Política Exterior Turquesa, Relaciones Exteriores, EE.UU, ONGs, Enviado Presidencial Especial de los Estados Unidos para el Clima del gobierno de, la Unión Europea, el Enviado Presidencial Especial, G7","La Tercera, Antonia Urrejola, Joe Biden, Felipe Vi, Gabriel Boric, John Kerry, Barack Obama","países, estados, unidos, chile, protección, presidente, américas, océano, marco, marinas"

93,2022-09-09,Subsecretaria Ximena Fuentes hace un llamado a la Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur a sumarse a Chile en su esfuerzo de promover la protección del océano,https://minrel.gob.cl/noticias-anteriores/subsecretaria-ximena-fuentes-hace-un-llamado-a-la-comision-permanente,0,0,0,0,minrel.gob.cl,Chile,"Subsecretaria Ximena Fuentes hace un llamado a la Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur a sumarse a Chile en su esfuerzo de promover la protección del océano

La Subsecretaria de Relaciones Exteriores, Ximena Fuentes, participó hoy en Lima, Perú, en el 70° aniversario de la Declaración de Santiago y de la creación de la Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur (CPPS), organismo encargado de coordinar y fomentar las políticas marítimas de los estados miembros (Colombia, Ecuador, Perú y Chile) para la conservación y uso responsable de los recursos naturales y su ambiente, en beneficio del desarrollo integral y sustentable de sus pueblos.

La CPPS nació en Chile en 1952 cuando se firmó la Declaración de Santiago, documento que declaró el principio de proyección jurisdiccional de las 200 millas marinas. Con ello, se sentó un precedente de gran trascendencia para el derecho internacional, recogido luego en la Convención de Naciones Unidas sobre Derecho del Mar.

La Subsecretaria Fuentes destacó que quienes conforman la Comisión “declaramos, hace 70 años, que el Pacífico Sur sudamericano es un área de diálogo, de ciencia, de desarrollo sostenible y de paz. También reconocimos que es un espacio que debemos proteger conjuntamente”.

En ese contexto, señaló que la triple crisis -cambio climático, pérdida de biodiversidad y contaminación- afecta directamente al océano, de manera visible y cada vez más severa. “La CPPS ha recogido este desafío, al crear planes de trabajo en múltiples áreas, incluyendo el Plan de Acción para la Protección del Medio Marino del Pacífico Sudeste”, afirmó.

Además, recordó que hace pocos días, en Punta Arenas, se lanzó la política exterior turquesa, “que consiste en una aproximación transversal a los temas ambientales, a través de la integración del azul del océano con el verde de los ecosistemas terrestres, y que incorpora una mirada de promoción y respeto de los derechos humanos”.

En la misma línea, destacó que el Gobierno del Presidente Gabriel Boric ha buscado dar continuidad al interés histórico de nuestro país por el océano, a través del lanzamiento de la Coalición Américas por la Protección del Océano, en la Cumbre de las Américas; proponiendo la aplicación inmediata del principio precautorio por el posible inicio de la minería submarina; y trabajando en el marco de la Organización de Ordenamiento Pesquero del Pacifico Sur, para proteger los espacios que se encuentran en alta mar de las dorsales submarinas de Nazca y de Salas y Gómez.

Finalmente, los invitó “a sumarse a Chile en este esfuerzo, en donde los cuatro países costeros del Pacifico Sur podemos promover conjuntamente la protección de ese espacio en el cual nos proyectamos, siendo vanguardistas nuevamente, tal como lo hicieron nuestros antecesores cuando dieron vida a la Declaración que hoy celebramos”.

En el encuentro participaron el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores del Perú, Miguel Ángel Rodríguez; los Viceministros de Colombia y Ecuador Francisco José Coy y Luis Vayas, además de la Viceministra de Relaciones Exteriores de Panamá, Ana Luisa Castro, por ser país observador y el Secretario General de la CPPS, José Luis Pérez.",es,"Punta Arenas, Ecuador, Perú, Colombia, Chile, Lima","la Viceministra de Relaciones Exteriores de Panamá, la Declaración de Santiago, el Pacífico Sur, CPPS, la Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur, el Plan de Acción para la Protección del Medio Marino del Pacífico Sudeste, el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores del Perú, la Convención de Naciones Unidas sobre Derecho del Mar.","Luis Vayas, Francisco Coy, Ximena Fuentes, Ana Castro, Miguel Rodríguez, Gabriel Boric, José Pérez","océano, pacífico, sur, chile, protección, subsecretaria, fuentes, comisión, cpps, ximena"

The Yellow Sea’s amber-tinged waters and coastlines teem with 1,600 different species of fauna – from dugongs and sea turtles to flounders and rockfish. The land around the sea also teems with humanity. More than 600 million people, or 10 percent of the global population, live on or near its shores and rely on its health for food and income.

A generation ago, it became increasingly clear that the rapid economic development of the surrounding region was placing a heavy strain on this fragile and valuable environment.

Over-fishing and pollution from industry, agriculture, and housing had depleted fish stocks, while many of the region’s tidal mudflats, key feeding grounds for migratory birds, had been lost to coastal reclamation. Biodiversity was also threatened by invasive species and ecosystem changes such as algal blooms and nutrient contamination.

To counterbalance these threats, the governments of China and the Republic of Korea began working with the Global Environment Facility and UN Development Programme (UNDP) in the mid-1990s to lay plans for the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem Project (YSLME).

A new report published by the YSLME project and available through the GEF’s International Waters knowledge-sharing platform IW:Learn details the array of innovative solutions introduced since the start of the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem project.

These have included the ranching of key marine species for reintroduction, government-led schemes to buy back fishing vessels and lessen pressure on stocks, enhanced monitoring of pollutants, and curbs on coastal reclamation and commercial fishing.

These initiatives have benefited the region in many ways: restoring marine forests around the picturesque island of Jeju to stem the spread of barren ground near the coast, helping to protect the tiny and critically endangered spoon-billed sandpiper, and encouraging cooperation with other countries to preserve the habitat of the spotted seal, one of the region’s flagship species.

The first phase of the project initially focused on helping the countries conduct a Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) of the Yellow Sea to pinpoint the most pressing environmental perils and their immediate and root causes.

This analysis formed the technical basis for the bilateral talks between China and the Republic of Korea that led up to the preparation and ministerial adoption of an initial Strategic Action Programme. Approved by both countries in 2009, the Programme set out pledges from the partners to take steps to reduce environmental pressures, such as fishing limits, improved management of sea and coastal areas, and pollution reduction targets.

A second phase of the project began in 2014 and closed in 2021. This phase resulted in the preparation of a new YSLME Strategic Action Programme for 2020-2030 and an updated TDA to guide and inform efforts.

A critical part of the initiative was the sharing of successes, challenges, and lessons, so other regions could learn from the marine restoration efforts of China and the Republic of Korea.

“Thanks to the results, experience and lessons from the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem Project, countries around the world are better equipped to put in place good practices on sustainable fisheries and aquaculture that can protect the ocean’s health and propel sustainable blue development,” said GEF CEO and Chairperson Carlos Manuel Rodriguez. “It is a shining example of what can be achieved through cooperation on shared marine resources.”",en,"China, the Republic of Korea, South Korea, Dongchu Village, Jeju","Strategic Action Programme, the Global Environment Facility, Programme, UNDP, UN Development Programme, International Waters, the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem Project, GEF, YSLME","Carlos Rodriguez, Yitao Zhang","sea, marine, yellow, project, korea, china, species, region, fishing, ecosystem"

[Photo provided to China Daily]

For fisherman Yang Tiansheng in Xiangshan county, Zhejiang province, the deep sea will always be filled with treasure, as long as it is well-protected and aquatic products are harvested in a scientific manner.

He told with excitement on Saturday about finding such a treasure.

""We hauled over 2,450 kilograms of large yellow croakers in a net on Friday,"" Yang said. ""And the heaviest one weighed more than 2 kilograms.""

Lin Haiping, the owner of the fishing boat on which Yang works, was immediately swarmed by buyers when he brought back the fish, the sales of which totaled 9.57 million yuan ($1.5 million).

""I've been fishing for 28 years but never caught so many yellow croakers of this size before,"" said Lin.

Fang Yue, chief engineer at the Xiangshan Water Resources and Fisheries Bureau, said, ""It is the first time that fishermen have caught so many wild yellow croakers in the East China Sea in over three decades.""

The yellow croaker, native to the western Pacific Ocean, is generally found in temperate waters such as the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, and has long served as a local specialty in coastal Ningbo, Zhejiang.

Most yellow croakers available in markets have been farm-raised and sell for between 30 and 60 yuan per kg, while those harvested from the ocean can be quite expensive, with larger ones selling for as much as 8,000 yuan per kg.

Large wild yellow croakers used to be abundant in the East China Sea, but the number has been dropping since about 45 years ago due to overfishing.

In 1979, Zhejiang launched an annual seasonal moratorium on fishing. It has been updated and promoted nationally since 1995, as part of efforts to promote sustainable fishing and improve the marine environment.

Fang said that the resurgence in the number of wild yellow croakers has resulted from the marine protection efforts.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the moratorium, which begins every summer and lasts more than three months, covers the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea and waters north of 12 degrees north latitude in the South China Sea.

During this period, safety inspections of fishing gear and a cleanup of illegal fishing vessels are carried out in these areas.

""The local authorities have released more than 10 species of fish in the East China Sea over the past five years. According to the monitoring data, the number of fish larvae is rising every year,"" said Fang.

He also emphasized the great contribution that fishermen from Xiangshan have made.

In 2000, 21 fishermen in Xiangshan founded China's first volunteer organization to better protect the seas and oceans around the world.

To date, more than 10,000 people have joined the organization.

In 2002, three fishermen from the county wrote to Kofi Annan, then secretary-general of the United Nations, calling on people around the world to protect the seas together.

Huang Genbao, head of the Xiangshan Fishing Association, said that although harvesting more than 1,000 kg of large yellow croakers doesn't happen often, he hoped that marine resource protection efforts will continue and more fishermen will have big hauls in the future.

Its plan to do so contrasts sharply with the UK’s ocean-focused efforts. As the same publication recently pointed out, the UK is failing to safeguard even its already designated ‘protected’ areas.

In short, Britain is not so ‘great’ when it comes to ocean protection. It’s lagging far behind teeny nations like Niue, despite having far more resources at its disposal.

Leading by example

Coastal nations have territorial rights over a certain amount of the ocean surrounding them, beyond their territorial waters. This is known as an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Guardian reported on 30 May that Niue has introduced a plan to protect 100% of its EEZ.

The plan, which has been in force since April, involves the creation of a “multiple-use” marine park. The country has zoned different parts of the park for specific purposes. It’s banned fishing in some zones, allowed small-scale fishing and recreation activities in others, and has a set area for commercial fishing. There’s also a “conservation zone” that boats can pass through but not dally in.

As Mongabay highlighted, the Cook Islands passed an Act in 2017 that laid out a similar 100% protection plan for its waters.

Setting a bad example

Compare Niue’s efforts with the UK. According to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, an advisory body, the country has designated 36% of its offshore waters as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). But analysis shared with the Guardian suggests that these are little more than ‘paper parks’, meaning protected in name but not in practice.

Global Fishing Watch and Oceana provided the analysis to the Guardian. They found that bottom trawling and dredging is taking place in over 90% of the UK’s offshore MPAs. Bottom trawling is a highly destructive form of fishing favoured by big commercial vessels – supertrawlers – that involves dragging weighed nets across the seabed.

Read on...

The data showed that in 2021, “fishing with bottom-towed gear” took place in no less than 58 of the 64 offshore MPAs designated as “benthic”. As the Guardian explained, these MPAs are specifically meant to “protect species that live on the seabed”.

Responding to the findings, a Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) spokesperson listed the fishing-related changes since Brexit. These include an upcoming ban on trawling in four MPAs; possible management changes in 13 other MPAs; a seafood fund to promote “innovation and sustainability”; consultation on a joint fisheries statement; and the “landmark Fisheries Act 2020”.

There’s the way but not the will

Of the upcoming trawling ban, Greenpeace’s Will McCallum said:

It’s taken two years [since Brexit] for the government to introduce trawling bans on four MPAs. The whole thing is taking too long and at the end, you have a ban on a single gear type – bottom-towed gear. But, in theory, a supertrawler could go straight though it.

Greenpeace has regularly fought against the government’s permissive attitude towards destructive fishing. In 2020 and 2021, for example, it dropped boulders into some MPAs to literally stop bottom trawlers in their tracks. The government’s Marine Management Organisation (MMO) responded by taking Greenpeace to court, a case it has since dropped.

That reaction is unsurprising in light of the Conservatives’ resistance to strengthening fishing laws. In 2020, Conservative MPs successfully defeated proposed amendments to the Fisheries Bill, the precursor to the aforementioned ‘landmark’ Act. These amendments were to keep fishing quotas within sustainable limits based on scientific advice and to ban supertrawlers in MPAs.

In short, the government appears to lack the will to take meaningful action to protect the ocean, despite being well equipped to do so. As Greenpeace has highlighted, the MMO issues licences to bottom trawlers and has the power to:

exclude specific fishing methods from specific areas, or even exclude boats entirely.

The right idea

Niue has the opposite problem. It appears to have the will to comprehensively protect the surrounding ocean, but lacks the means to do so entirely independently. It is a small island nation that is self-governing and, like the Cook Islands, maintains ‘free association‘ with New Zealand. As such, it’s reliant on neighbours, like other islands and New Zealand, to help police its waters. Global Fishing Watch also assists with monitoring of the marine park through satellite surveillance.

Niue and other island nations clearly aren’t short of the right ideas though. Over-fishing is one of the top threats to the ocean, of which there are many. Stringently protecting the ocean from it is essential.

Britain’s expulsion of Chagos islanders from their Indian Ocean home in the 1960s and 70s is a shameful moment in its history. The eviction, which the UK carried out after allegedly pressuring Mauritius to sell it the islands ahead of independence, is an enduring part of the former’s colonial legacy. Chagossians continue to fight for the right to return home to this day.

At the recent UN Ocean Conference in Portugal, Mauritius laid out an ambitious plan. It could enable the resettlement of some Chagossians on the islands. The proposal involves the establishment of a vast Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the Chagos archipelago.

‘Get some rocks which will remain ours’

As historian and journalist Mark Curtis explained in his book Web of Deceit: Britain’s Real Role in the World, the UK effectively created a new colony during its mid-20th Century decolonisation process. Curtis noted that a UK official laid out their aim in a secret file, namely to “get some rocks which will remain ours”. The new colony included Mauritius’s Chagos archipelago and islands which were part of the Seychelles. The UK named this area the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).

Since 1966, the UK has leased some of these ‘rocks’ to the US military. It brutally removed the Chagossians to facilitate the deal and assert its claim to the islands, allegedly poisoning and gassing the islanders’ beloved dogs in the process. The US has a base on Diego Garcia, the archipelago’s biggest island, which was given its name by the UK, according to the organisation CAGE.

The UK handed the Seychelles its islands back in 1976 when it gained independence, ostensibly because the US and UK militaries didn’t plan to use them. But it has fought tooth and claw to keep hold of the Chagos archipelago. The US military lease there doesn’t expire until 2036.

Illegal MPA

The UK created a massive Marine Protected Area/ MPA around the archipelago in 2010. It claims the MPA serves to “ensure the future protection” of the highly biodiverse waters. But WikiLeaks has released US state department cables that indicate UK officials believed the MPA would stymie resettlement of Chagossians for the long-term.

Read on...

Mauritius challenged the legality of the MPA under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). As David Snoxell, the UK’s Chagos Islands All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) coordinator, recently wrote in Mauritian publication l’Express Weekly, the BIOT MPA banned Mauritius from inshore fishing in Chagos waters. The UK had committed to such access for Mauritius in the original agreement for the purchase of the islands.

The UNCLOS tribunal ruled the MPA unlawful in a 2015 decision.

Successive rulings against the UK

This is just one in a series of determinations against the UK in relation to the archipelago in recent years.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory ruling in 2019 that the separation of the islands was unlawful. Later that year, a majority of UN member states also voted in a non-binding resolution that the UK should hand the territory back to Mauritius.

In 2021, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) confirmed Mauritius’s sovereignty over the Chagos Islands and urged the UK to end its occupation of them. ITLOS is currently engaged in establishing the maritime boundaries between Mauritius and the Maldives, known as delimiting. Once that’s done, the former intends to move forward with its own plan for an extensive MPA.

Biodiversity, sovereignty, and resettlement

Mauritius laid out the plan at an event at the UN Ocean Conference on 1 July. Dr Rezah Badal, director general of the Department for Continental Shelf, Maritime Zones Administration & Exploration, ​explained that the country will take a “scientific approach” to the MPA.

It will rely on four key principles, he said. These are:

Biodiversity preservation and protection.

“Restitution of the cultural assets” of the archipelago.

Resettlement of Mauritians, including Chagossians, along with “accompanying sustainable fisheries”.

Maritime security for the region.

The country extended an open invite for cooperation from the international community, including those in the scientific and environmental sphere, in establishing and managing the multi-purpose MPA. The plan currently is to designate the vast majority – 520,000 km² – of the 650,000 km² area as a ‘sustainable use zone’ with “limited fishing activities”.

Additionally, there will be a conservation zone and habitat protection zone where Mauritius permits some controlled human activities. These will be accompanied by a strict conservation zone of around 37,000 km² that will have “strictly controlled and limited” activity. Last, but by no means least, there will be a resettlement zone measuring some 9,000 km².

The Canary asked the Mauritian government whether it will permit industrial fishing, which is typically highly damaging to marine ecosystems, anywhere in the MPA. No comment was received by the time of publication.

Not an invitation for excessive exploitation

Pre-recorded comments at the event from Mauritius’s prime minister Pravind Jugnauth indicated that resettled Chagossians will be the “future custodians of the MPA”. President of the Chagos Refugee Group Oliver Bancoult also spoke in the session. He left his island home of Peros Banhos in the archipelago at the age of four.

Bancoult asserted that assessments a few years after the Chagossians’ removal showed that their around 200 year presence on the islands had left coral reefs in a “near pristine state”. Looking forward, he said:

we will run a sustainable and well-managed fisheries both to feed ourselves and to provide income and employment and, if possible, export food to other nations.

Bancoult further insisted that the MPA is “not an invitation to foreign states to remove precious resources from our homeland”.

Conservation is vital

As Rev Ocean’s Dr Alex Rogers explained in a pre-recorded presentation, the waters around the archipelago are extremely important in ecological terms. They contain between 25-50% of Indian ocean coral reefs considered in an excellent condition. Meanwhile, the fish in these reefs are six times as abundant as reefs elsewhere in the Indian ocean, which Rogers’ presentation indicated was largely due to the presence of large fish, such as sharks.

Additionally, the locality is a key nesting area for both green and hawksbill turtles. It’s also important for bird species, with 12 of the islands “classifiable” as Important Bird Areas (IBAs) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Rogers explained that the proposed MPA contains both opportunities and risks. Done well, it could ensure protection of the reefs and wildlife, with Chagossians able to monitor and limit damaging activities, such as illegal fishing, after resettlement. But ensuring the sustainability of fishing activities – particularly the protection of bigger fish such as sharks – is paramount to its success.

Insufficient protections

According to speakers at the event, illegal fishing is an existing issue in the locality. Philippe Sands QC, legal advisor to the Mauritius government on the Chagos Islands, explained that the UK’s MPA is meant to be a ‘no-take’ zone aside from three nautical miles around the US base. But despite this, the UK hasn’t passed any regulations to enforce that zone. Moreover, he said that the UK only has a single vessel patrolling the 640,000 km² area.

The Canary asked the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office about the level of protection in its declared MPA and Mauritius’s plan. A spokesperson said:

We do not recognise the proposals made by Mauritius at the 2022 UN Oceans Conference. The UK declared the British Indian Ocean Territory Marine Protected Area in 2010.

Demands answered

Others in the UK, however, have taken a different position. Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is honorary president of the Chagos Islands APPG. He told The Canary:

I welcome this Mauritian initiative because, unlike the BIOT MPA of April 2010, it is in conformity with international law and the requirements of international courts (ICJ, UNCLOS Tribunal) and the UN General Assembly.

He said that the UK’s MPA “was intended to be” a barrier to the resettlement that Mauritius’s plan offers the Chagossians. And he insisted that the APPG will continue to champion the cause of the Chagos community, some of whom live in the UK.

Corbyn highlighted that the Chagos community “have been extremely active in making their needs known over the years”. For some Chagossians, Mauritius’s plan for the MPA promises to meet those needs.

El océano es «patrimonio de la humanidad», supone el 71 % de la superficie del planeta, con alta mar (más conocida como área más allá de la jurisdicción nacional o ABNJ, por sus siglas en inglés) que abarca el 64 % y del que «apenas está protegido el 1 %», señala en entrevista con EFE Gladys Martínez, abogada costarricense que estará presente en la negociaciones para lograr un Tratado de Alta Mar, que se llevarán a cabo en Nueva York del 7 al 18 de marzo.

Tratado de Alta Mar «global e inclusivo»

Las negociaciones -que llevan 15 años- pretenden dar paso a «un Tratado de Alta Mar global para la conservación y uso sostenible de los recursos de las áreas fuera de la jurisdicción de cada país, y a la vez inclusivo, es decir que contemple todas las actividades que se desarrollen en ese espacio», actualizando así la Convemar.

La Convención de Naciones Unidas sobre el Derecho al Mar (Convemar o también conocida como CDM, CNUDM o UNCLOS, en inglés) se firmó en 1982 en Nueva York, sin embargo, solo entró en vigor en 1994, un año después de la 60 ratificación del documento por parte de Guyana.

El nuevo documento pretende regular actividades como la minería marina, porque «existen muchos intereses y presiones» actualmente en las negociaciones en la Autoridad Internacional de los Fondos Marinos (ISA, en inglés) para otorgar permisos de explotación a corto plazo, no solo de exploración, cuando aún no hay estándares de impacto ambiental de una actividad que supondría un «daño muy preocupante» para los ecosistemas marinos «que apenas se conocen», además del transporte de mercancías o la contaminación.

Hay países que pretenden además que «la pesca quede fuera de esta regulación», según Martínez, algo que «permitiría dejar la puerta abierta para excluir otras actividades como la minería marina, el transporte marítimo, el cableado submarino». (Le sugerimos: Así hemos afectado la migración de las ballenas)

Marco regulatorio y sistema de gobernanza

Por ello, el nuevo Tratado busca crear «un marco regulatorio y un sistema de gobernanza» que además de englobar las actividades que se puedan desarrollar en alta mar», «sea un documento robusto de implementación, que contemple la obligación de realizar «estudios de impacto ambiental» con unos «estándares altos» que incluyan toda la cadena de impactos de una actividad y no solo en el lugar donde se realice, es decir que mida los efectos acumulativos de toda actividad».

Según la representante de High Seas Alliance, organización que aglutina a 40 ongs y de la que forma parte la Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (UICN) para asesorar a las partes, esta reunión en la que están presentes todos los países integrantes de la ONU «debería ser la última», no obstante, los efectos de la pandemia del covid-19 podría prolongar las negociaciones «a una próxima cita» hasta llegar a una resolución de Naciones Unidas.

Las negociaciones se están llevando a cabo por grupos regionales, explica Gladys Martínez -asesora del grupo de países de Latinoamérica-, «entre los que Costa Rica y Chile han sido los más activos para lograr un acuerdo», pero también se encuentran diseñando sus estrategias el de la Unión Europea, el Caribe, los asiáticos, entre otros.

Además, aunque no es un grupo, intervienen los países que no tienen salida al mar liderados por Suiza, y en el que está -entre otros- Paraguay, porque no quieren quedar «excluidos» de los beneficios que se puedan obtener de los hallazgos en alta mar, como puedan ser «la cura al cáncer o el elixir de la eterna juventud».

Todos los grupos regionales «están planteando en este momento» sus posiciones y los puntos que van a debatir o acordar en la negociación de los elementos de este Tratado en alta mar, espacio «que incluye el cuerpo de agua», donde «hay mucha vida y suceden muchos movimientos migratorios de especies».

Estructura y herramientas del Tratado

De ahí la importancia del Tratado, que está compuesto por lo que los expertos conocen como «elementos del paquete» del documento e incluye -entre otros- «las herramientas de manejo espacial marino, que abarcan las áreas marinas protegidas y las reservas; las evaluaciones de impacto ambiental; los recursos genéticos marinos y la creación de capacidades y tecnología».

Además de estos temas, subraya la abogada costarricense, en la negociación del Tratado de Alta Mar se incluye aspectos que «regulen la estructura» del mismo, como la creación de «un comité científico» que revise continuamente lo que sucede en el océano y su evolución, «la celebración de una conferencia de las partes (COP), entre otros aspectos». (Lea también: Más de 3.000 millones de personas viven en contextos altamente vulnerables al cambio climático)

Asimismo, los grupos regionales estudian actualmente «un texto enviado por la presidencia» de la Convención para la protección del océano, un espacio que ocupa dos tercios del planeta, dice Martínez, y cuya importancia radica en que es uno de los reguladores del clima y de su conservación y protección depende que la crisis climática se reduzca al ser uno de los captores de las emisiones de dióxido de carbono (CO2) más importantes.

102,2022-01-24,Colombia's Operation Artemisa extends frontline to ocean protection | The City Paper Bogotá,https://thecitypaperbogota.com/news/colombias-operation-artemisa-extends-frontline-to-ocean-conservation/29213,62,58,4,0,thecitypaperbogota.com,Colombia,"Operation Artemisa was created in 2019 as a joint task force between the Ministries of Environment and Defense to combat illegal deforestation inside Colombia’s National Parks. Named after a Greek Goddess who with bow and arrow was the guardian of wildlife and protector of forests, “Artemisa” set out to secure large swathes of the Orinoco and Amazon basins in the interests of national security.

With plenty of military hardware to patrol remote regions of the country, Artemisa became a pillar of the government’s 2019/2020 National Development Plan, and for the former Presidential Security Advisor Rafael Guarín, its core mission is to “guarantee the nation’s integrity by protecting the essential right to water, a clean environment and biodiversity.”

In the on-going fight to protect endangered habits, Colombia’s eco-warriors are taking the frontline to the nation’s oceans, enlisting support from the Navy to target illegal fishing and indiscriminate trawling. During a visit to Gorgona National Park on Sunday, President Iván Duque extended Artemisa’s reach to also focus on protecting coral reefs and atolls, home to 45% of world’s marine species. President Duque reiterated that the Navy maintains a permanent presence on Gorgona Island together with the National Coastguard.

Rear Admiral Francisco Hernando Cubides, Commander of the Pacific Naval Force, declared that the entire capacity of the Navy is available to meet the challenges of Artemisa at sea. “Our units in this region provide not only security, but environmental development in this important region of the country,” he stressed. Rear Admiral Cubides highlighted that Operation Artemisa includes Utría National Natural Park, Uramba Natural Park (Bahía Málaga, Valle del Cauca), Gorgona National Park, Malpelo Flora and Fauna Sanctuary, the Yuruparí district, as well as the Sanquianga Park in Nariño.

Since launching in 2019, Artemisa’s 22,000-strong jungle guardians have managed to recover more than 146,000 hectares of tropical forest belonging to PNN Chiribiquete and the Llanos de Yarí watershed. Hundreds of military sorties, have resulted in arrests of persons charged with environmental crimes, including setting fires in protected parkland, toxic chemical dumping, illegal mining and animal trafficking.

“For the first time in our history, we have aligned our domestic agenda, with foreign policy, and national security objectives with the sole aim of protecting our natural resources,” believes Guarín. President Duque during the Glasgow COP26 Summit declared 30% of the nation’s total land and sea territory as “protected areas.”",en,"Nariño, Colombia, Bogotá, Valle del Cauca, Bahía Málaga, Yuruparí","the Pacific Naval Force, The City Paper, Ministries of Environment, Operation Artemisa, Navy, the National Coastguard, Defense","Francisco Cubides, Iván Duque, Rafael Guarín","artemisa, national, park, security, colombia, operation, illegal, nation, navy, gorgona"

La Havane, 30 juin (RHC) Cuba a souligné ce jeudi à Lisbonne que la gestion partagée des océans, ainsi que la réflexion sur leur durabilité doit être l’une des priorités de la gestion des gouvernements.

Lors de son discours à la Conférence sur les Océans, promue par les Nations Unies à l’aide du Kenya et du Portugal, le premier vice-ministre cubain des Sciences, de la Technologie et de l’Environnement, (CITMA), José Fidel Santana, a souligné l’importance de ces affaires pour la survie et le développement des petits États insulaires.

Se référant à la convention des Nations Unies sur le droit à la mer, il a souligné que la rencontre de Lisbonne, « nous unit dans un objectif commun : Protéger et préserver nos mers et nos océans ».

José Santana a déclaré que cuba ratifie le fait que la protection de l’environnement au niveau mondial, doit être conforme au principe de responsabilités communes mais différenciées, ainsi que sur l’impératif de coopération régionale et internationale, notamment dans les pays des Caraïbes, qui sont vulnérables et dépendent des secteurs tels que le tourisme.

Le premier vice-ministre du CITMA a signalé que la plus grande île des Antilles favorise la mise en œuvre de modèles de développement durable, basés sur les connaissances scientifiques et la technologie, l’éthique, la politique environnementale orientée vers le développement durable et reflétant les circonstances nationales.

En outre, le renforcement des mécanismes pour la mise en œuvre, tels que les ressources financières provenant de sources multilatérales, le renforcement des capacités et le transfert de technologies, entre autres.

“Nous défendons la promotion des océans comme source d’énergie propre et durable, ainsi que le besoin de financement pour le développement d’une économie circulaire favorisant la gestion des droits », a-t-il ajouté.

Pour Cuba, les questions liées à l’environnement constituent une priorité stratégique, ce qui se reflête dans la nouvelle Constitution de la République, approuvée en 2019, où « vivre dans un environnement sain et équilibré », est reconnu comme un droit citoyen, a-t-il souligné.

D’autre part, Santana a évoqué une nouvelle loi sur le système de ressources naturelles et de l’environnement, récemment approuvée, qui « consacre une partie de ses articles à la protection spéciale de nos eaux intérieures et les mers qui nous entourent ».

Il a expliqué que dans le Plan nationale de développement économique et social jusqu’en 2030, Cuba a proposé des objectifs ambitieux pour l’eau, la réduction du plastique ; la prévention et la confrontation des crimes et illégalités qui affectent la flore et la faune sauvages.

En outre, nous avons à présent 24 % de la production d’énergies à partir de sources renouvelables et le recours aux transports terrestres à faible taux d’émission s’est accru.

En 2017 notre pays a approuvé le Plan de l’État pour la lutte contre le changement climatique, a-t-il rappelé.

Il a également évoqué le projet de résilience côtière au changement climatique à Cuba, approuvé par le Conseil d’administration du Fonds vert pour le climat, malgré l’opposition solitaire des États-Unis,» comme une démonstration de la cruauté du blocus qui dure depuis plus de 60 ans pour de simples raisons politiques ».

Il a déploré la persistance de visions égoïstes et inamicales, de mesures unilatérales et des blocus économique, qui ne rendent pas service à la promotion des mers et d’océans plus propres, ainsi qu’à la transition vers des économies plus durables en fonction des vulnérabilités et sur un pied d’égalité.

Ecuador has created a huge new marine reserve north of the Galápagos Islands, with the ultimate aim of forming a protected corridor north to Costa Rica.

The designation will help to protect a wide range of migratory oceanic fauna, including sharks, sea turtles and various bird species.



Sharks, such as Scalloped Hammerhead, are among the species that will benefit from the extension of the Marine Protected Area around the Galápagos (Ryan Espanto / commons.wikimedia.org).

Ecuadorian president, Guillermo Laso, signed the decree creating the new reserve (called 'Hermandad', meaning brotherhood) and cut a ribbon made of materials collected from coastal clean-up operations conducted in the Galápagos.

The new reserve is incorporated into an existing reserve that has existed since March 1998, expanding the marina protected area around the archipelago from 138,000 km2 to 198,000 km2.

Authorities are planning for protected areas in adjacent Colombia and Panama to join later, creating an international marine biosphere reserve that stretches north to Costa Rica's Cocos Island National Park, which was also recently expanded.

The creation of the Hermandad reserve is a ""clear message for the world"", said Lasso, who also described it as a ""new relationship with the Earth, a new understanding of what constitutes progress for humanity"".



Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso with the decree for the expansion of the Galapagos marine reserve.

Colombian President Ivan Duque and former US president Bill Clinton also attended the event, together with government officials from Costa Rica and Panama.

Duque said that eventually adding Colombia's Malpelo islands and Panama's Coiba islands to the vast marine reserve will allow for the safe migrations of fauna such as sea turtles, whales, sharks and manta rays.

The new reserve ""will guarantee the survival of 40% of the world's marine species"", Duque said.

Lasso added that ""the seas are great regulators of the global climate"" and that ""taking care of them is not naive idealism, it is a vital necessity"".

Extending the reserve by 60,000 square kilometers (23,166 square miles) is the first step in a plan agreed by Ecuador with its close neighbors Colombia, Costa Rica and Panama at the U.N. Climate Summit in Glasgow last year to create a common corridor through which species threatened by climate change and industrial fishing can migrate.

The existing Galapagos marine reserve, one of the largest in the world, measures some 138,000 square kilometers (53,282 square miles), and the new conservation area will see 198,000 square kilometers (76,448 square miles) protected.

“Today we’re declaring a marine reserve with an area of 60,000 square kilometers, equivalent to an area three times the size of Belize,” Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso said after signing the new reserve into existence aboard the Sierra Negra research vessel docked in Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island, the Galapagos’ tourist hub.

During the U.N. Climate Summit Lasso said he hoped the plan to expand the reserve would get financing via a conservation debt swap. However on Friday, Lasso did not reveal any financing details.

Environmentalists say the reserve will help protect at least five critically endangered species — including hammer sharks, whale sharks, turtles, as well as other species that migrate between the Galapagos and Costa Rica’s Cocos Island.

Even though it will squeeze the space available to Ecuadorian fishing crews, it will not avoid the presence of a 300-ship Chinese fishing fleet https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-environment-china/chinese-fishing-vessels-leave-area-near-ecuadors-galapagos-idUSKCN26D2VK?enowpopup that anchors in international waters just off the islands each year as they hunt for giant squid.

The impact of this fleet on the Galapagos’ ecosystem has not yet been determined by Ecuador.

President Guillermo Lasso displays the signed decree, Jan. 14 (Presidencia ECU)

On Friday, Ecuadoran President Guillermo Lasso formalized a new marine reserve, dramatically expanding the protected waters around the Galapagos Islands.

The decision was first announced in November, coinciding with the COP26 climate conference, and was finalized with a signing ceremony on Friday. The presidential decree establishes a new 17,500 square nautical mile marine protected area to the north of the Galapagos, called the Hermandad Marine Reserve. It expands the 39,000 square nm Galapagos Marine Reserve by nearly 50 percent.

The new reserve area is part of a planned marine thoroughfare for migratory sharks, whales, sea turtles, manta rays and other creatures that transit between the Galapagos and Costa Rica's Cocos Island, located about 400 nm to the northeast. Neighboring Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica are discussing plans to contribute marine reserves of their own to complete a continuous, protected path between and around the islands.

Half of the new Hermandad Reserve is fully protected from fishing activity, and the other half is covered by a longline fishing ban. The measure had strong local support in the tourism- and fishery-dependent Galapagos, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.

“We’re proud that our local community and the fishing industry came together in support of these marine protections. We all depend on the continued vitality of these rich waters and understand that preserving our ocean provides significant social, economic, and environmental benefits,"" said Ecuador's minister for the environment, Gustavo Manrique.

However, the expansion of the marine reserve will only change facts on the ground if it is enforced, according to conservationists. Enric Sala, head of the marine-reserve NGO Pristine Seas and a National Geographic explorer-in-residence, told the Washington Post that it's common to find longliners operating illegally inside of the existing Galapagos reserve. Without added enforcement effort, the same illegal fishing operations might continue in the new Hermandad Reserve, he suggested.

In remarks accompanying the signing of the decree, President Lasso called for a whole-of-society effort to preserve Ecuador's oceans. ""I invite civil society, academia, private companies and NGOs to join this purpose. Let us continue joining efforts to conserve and care for this treasure of the Earth, for present and future generations,"" he said.",en,"Ecuador, Costa Rica, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica's","the Pew Charitable Trusts, Presidencia ECU, Pristine Seas, NGOs, National Geographic, the Washington Post","Gustavo Manrique, Guillermo Lasso, Enric Sala","marine, reserve, galapagos, new, ecuador, area, fishing, percent, president, lasso"

Half of that area will be fully protected where no extractive activities are allowed, according to Mission Blue.

The new protected area known as La Hermandad, “the sisterhood,” will extend to Costa Rica’s maritime border and will allow more than one country to manage marine life like sharks, sea turtles and whales.

“Her Deepness” Dr. Sylvia Earle, founder of Mission Blue, lauded the Galapagos Islands’ new status:

“Bravo, President Guillermo Lasso, and all who are supporting enhanced protection for wildlife in the ocean surrounding the Galápagos Islands, where most of the terrain is submerged – and most of the animals are aquatic. Protecting sardines and sharks have benefits that are as significant as safeguarding creatures like songbirds and sea lions. All are integral to the magical nature of the ‘Enchanted Islands’ with profound benefits to the world beyond.”

Together with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), the Italian National Promotional Institution and Financial Institution for Development Cooperation, and ICO, the Spanish Promotional Bank, the Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and KfW acting on behalf of the German Federal Government committed to double the Clean Oceans Initiative target. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was also welcomed as a new member.

Given the threats to the oceans and the urgency to protect this natural resource, the Clean Oceans Initiative has decided to increase its funding target to €4 billion by the end of 2025, rather than the €2 billion originally planned for 2023.

Reducing plastic

The Clean Oceans Initiative is the world’s largest collaborative effort to fund projects aimed at reducing marine plastic pollution. In just three years, the Initiative has already met 80% of its goal by providing € 1.6 billion in long-term funding to public and private sector projects that improve solid waste, wastewater, and storm water management to reduce the discharge of plastics, microplastics, and other litter into the oceans. More than 20 million people in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Europe will benefit from projects signed so far under the initiative.

Every year, more than 8 million tonnes of plastic waste is estimated to enter the oceans. Estuaries, coral reefs, fish, and millions of people who rely on the oceans are all threatened by pollution. The majority of plastic in the oceans comes from waste that has been thrown on the ground or washed into rivers. Many developing countries could reduce the 1.5 million tonnes of microplastics that end up in the oceans each year with better wastewater treatment and stormwater management. Plastic pollution is increasing in many cities around the world due to rapid population growth.

Food, medicines, renewable energy, and natural resources are just a few of the many benefits that the oceans provide to the planet and its inhabitants. The oceans provide a source of income and a healthy diet for billions of people. Oceans play an important role in climate change. They absorb about 30% of the world’s carbon dioxide, helping to mitigate the effects of global warming.",en,France,"ICO, Clean Oceans Initiative, the Clean Oceans Initiative, The Clean Oceans Initiative, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, KfW, CDP, The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Initiative, EIB, the Agence Française de Développement, the European Investment Bank, EBRD, AFD",,"oceans, initiative, clean, plastic, target, bank, world, projects, pollution, waste"

The Protected Marine Area “Capo Rizzuto” offers to visitors an exclusive itinerary through an heritage of considerable value, in which nature converges with history and archeology: a journey between the legend and the myth, with scent of a crystalline sea that bathes the fine amber sand and the steep cliffs. With its eight promontories, the area includes two places of interest with very ancient origins: it’s bordered to the north by the Lacinio promontory, on which stands the archeological site of Capo Colonna and in which you can find, along with many remains of buildings, the last surviving column of the temple dedicated to Hera (or Era), the Greek patron deity of marriage; in the meantime it’s bordered to the south by Punta delle Castella or more commonly le Castella, a fishing village and fraction of Isola Capo Rizzuto, rich of Greek-Roman archaeological remains and are still visible, as well as by the famous Aragonese Castle, a probable Magna Graecia fortification erected on a small peninsula on the sea. The establishment of the Protected Marine Area derives from a dual objective: environmental preservation, unique for the entire costal area, and archaeological preservation, given the rich heritage that holds it.

With 1.6 million km2, this reserve located in the south of the Indian Ocean becomes the largest marine protected area in France, and the second largest in the world.

This extension of nearly one million km2 is one of the key measures of the French National Strategy for Protected Areas 2030, and allows France to exceed the target of 30% of French maritime and terrestrial areas in protected areas.

This measure also highlight the richness of the exceptional natural heritage of the French Southern Territories, which harbor a rich biodiversity, representative of the biological diversity of the Southern Ocean. For example, there is the world’s largest population of king penguins, and the second largest population of elephant seals. The French Southern Territories also represent the migration route of Antarctic blue and pygmy whales, as well as the reserve of a great diversity of endemic or sub-endemic birds. Finally, these areas also act as carbon sinks, thus contributing to the climate balance.

“Not because it’s simple or comfortable, but because these protections can’t wait,” Mr Bainimarama said.

“These investments can’t wait, nor can the jobs they create.

“In two years’ time, the Lau seascape, an area representing 8 per cent of Fiji’s ocean, will be a marine protected area, our largest step to date towards protecting 30 per cent of our ocean by 2030.”

Mr Bainimarama said by 2030, Fiji would achieve total real-time surveillance of its waters.

“We will be virtually single-use plastic free and recycle all PET bottles; ocean literacy will be mandatory within our education system and we’ll lower carbon emissions in our shipping sector by 40 per cent.

“By 2030, we will produce at least 160k metric tonnes of sustainably farmed and harvested ocean product, supporting 53,000 new jobs on the way to supply half of our blue foods from sustainable fisheries by 2035. “And by 2050 we aim to create 100,000 new jobs in sustainable fisheries.”

He also said by 2050, Fiji would be a net-zero society.

In a virtual Our Ocean Conference pre-event sponsored by the Sasakawa Foundation, President Whipps said Pacific nations have always taken “great responsibility” in the management and protection of the ocean.

He said ground breaking ocean initiative originated by the Pacific including the famed Palau National Marine Sanctuary (PNMS).

But at the same time, the region is facing threats from the impact of climate change.

“The Pacific islands have been at the forefront of the climate, the climate change impacts. We have been hit by storms, sea-level rise, droughts, you name it, we have it. And now all of those lead to huge economic losses. In fact, it even affects our tourism industry because it destroys our coral reefs. kills our jellyfish and we’re concerned about the impacts that will have to the tuna of stocks,” President Whipps said.

Palau is hosting the conference in Palau on 13- 14 April, marking the first time that the Our Ocean Conference will be hosted by a small island developing state.

The conference is expected to spur global ocean action and commitments to advance sustainable fishing, promote marine protected areas, combat ocean plastic pollution, support maritime security, foster a blue economy, and create an ocean resilient to climate impacts.

Minister of Agriculture Fisheries and Environment (MAFE) Steven Victor said the conference is the chance to “continue to engage the global community in looking at ocean issues.”

He also called on the nations to prioritise actions on the ocean, especially during the post-Covid-economy.

“So we are at a crossroad here in Palau in really looking at recovery from the pandemic and reevaluating our ocean policies that ensure that we find the balance between large-scale ocean conservation and sustainable developments that support small island developing states,” he said.

He made this statement at the launch of the Marine Protected Area National Consultation at the i-Taukei Trust Board grounds, this morning.



Bainimarama said Fiji has put forward some of the most comprehensive ocean and climate commitments on the planet.



He said that Fiji has just launched 17 Voluntary Commitments towards the protections and sustainable management of Fiji’s oceans at the United Nations Oceans Conference which Fiji co-hosted with Sweden.

“We walked the talk by embedding the implementation, monitoring and evaluation process of our commitment into law.”



“Government’s ocean commitments are enshrined in Fiji’s five-year and 20-year National Development Plan in 2017; and most recently factored into Fiji’s National Oceans Policy and historic Climate Change Act,” he added.



He said that in his meetings with the US President Joe Biden he conveyed in no uncertain terms the criticality of the moment.



“The Pacific Ocean cleans the air we breathe – virtually operating as earth’s single lung now following the widespread destruction of the Amazon rainforest.”



“Secondly, without a doubt, the Pacific will provide the protein needed for a much of the world in the future through fish and seafood.”



He said for this to continue it needs to be protected.



“We need to engineer a highly sustainable, conservation-learning and forward-looking blue and green economy – from green shipping to aqua-culture, to carbon trading and to expanding our marine protected areas.”



He said the US was increasing its contribution to the green climate fund, which is beneficial to all Small Island States, including Fiji.



He added that the Pacific-European Union Marine Partnership Program is also helping Fiji address some of the most serious challenges faced in the Pacific including the increasing depletion of fisheries resources.

“OECMs, a relatively novel conservation approach, are an important part of the HELCOM agenda as well, as reflected by the 2021 Baltic Sea Action Plan, which contains no fewer than seven actions related to spatial conservation measures, and which explicitly refers to OECMs in several places,” said Rüdiger Strempel, the Executive Secretary of HELCOM, adding that OECMs could, among other things, contribute to strengthening the overall coherence of the HELCOM MPA network.

The workshop contributed to developing a common understanding of the applicability of the OECM criteria to the specific situation in the Baltic Sea, as well as a better comprehension of the potential of OECMs for supporting the attainment of the HELCOM objectives on marine conservation, including their interplay with existing MPAs.

“OECMs should have a spatial component, bring clear biodiversity benefits that are long lasting, and should not cause any significant harm to other biodiversity attributes as a consequence of their implementation,” explained Jannica Haldin, the Deputy Executive Secretary of HELCOM.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the distinguishing criterion between MPAs and OECMs is that the former have a primary conservation objective, whereas OECMs deliver effective in-situ conservation of biodiversity regardless of their primary objectives.

“From the perspective of biodiversity in the sea, labels do not matter – what matters is the effect a measure has on the environment,” said Haldin. “The main principle of OECMs is that they must provide a positive outcome for biodiversity.”

“Using a measure as a starting point is what differentiates the OECM process from traditional conservation approaches, and enables us to consider the effect of measures that weren’t initially put in place for conservation purposes,” added Haldin.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) defines other effective area-based conservation measures as areas other than protected areas including MPAs that “achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in-situ conservation of biodiversity”, which in turn contributes to preserving “ecosystem functions and services” and in some cases “cultural, spiritual, socio–economic, and other locally relevant values”.

The workshop was attended by a broad range of stakeholders dealing with issues related to the marine environment, bringing together representatives of government agencies, non-governmental organization and academia.",en,,"IUCN WCPA, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, The Convention on Biological Diversity, HELCOM, IUCN, CBD, OECM, OECMs, FAO","Jannica Haldin, Rüdiger Strempel","conservation, oecms, helcom, measures, biodiversity, marine, sea, mpas, baltic, areas"

Son objectif: empêcher des pratiques «destructrices» de pêche industrielle.

«Nous plaçons de grosses roches calcaire sur le fond marin pour créer une barrière protectrice qui mettra la zone hors de portée de la pêche destructrice», explique Anna Diski, une militante à bord du bateau.

L’idée: rendre impossible la pêche au chalut de fond, ces énormes filets utilisés par d’immenses navires de pêche qui abiment les fonds marins et tuent des espèces non ciblées.

À bord de l’Arctic Sunrise , le célèbre navire océanographique du groupe de défense de l’environnement, les militants ont largué jeudi en mer, au cœur d’une zone marine officiellement protégée, 18 blocs de calcaire pesant entre 500 et 1 400 kilos.

Le gouvernement appelé à « faire son travail»

De quoi «empêcher immédiatement les chalutiers destructeurs de pouvoir opérer dans la zone en les empêchant de traîner leurs filets de pêche le long du fond marin», ajoute-t-elle.

Pour Will McCallum, responsable à Greenpeace UK, il s’agit d’une action «pour protéger les océans en dernier ressort». «Nous préfèrerions largement que le gouvernement fasse son travail», affirme-t-il alors que les chaluts de fond sont autorisés dans la majorité des zones marines protégées du pays.

Pour lui, l’autorisation d’une telle pratique dans ces zones est «scandaleuse» et «ridiculise notre soi-disant (politique de) ""protection""».

Des discussions ont échoué à l’ONU

«Pour notre futur», «Simon Pegg» ou encore «Stephen Fry»: les activistes ont inscrit sur les blocs de calcaire des messages ou les noms de célébrités qui soutiennent l’action.

Une des roches jetées en mer a été taillée en forme d’ammonite, un fossile qu’on trouve souvent dans les rochers de Portland, presqu’île de la «Jurassic Coast» anglaise d’où sont issus les blocs de pierre.

L’action de Greenpeace intervient alors que des discussions à l’ONU ont échoué la semaine dernière pour établir un traité international pour les océans.

Selon le groupe écologiste, les South West Deeps sont l’«une des ""Zones marines protégées où la pêche est la plus importante au Royaume-Uni». Il appelle le gouvernement et le futur Premier ministre, qui sera désigné la semaine prochaine, à «interdire la pêche industrielle dans toutes les zones marines britanniques protégées en modifiant les licences de pêche».

Des navires français dans le viseur

L’organisation cite des chiffres de l’observatoire «Global Fishing Watch» qui affirme que 110 navires -dont plus de la moitié venus de France- ont pêché près de 19 000 heures dans la zone en 18 mois. Parmi eux, les navires à chalut de fond ont passé 3 376 heures dans la zone protégée.

«Le Royaume-Uni a des zones marines protégées qui ne sont protégées que par leur nom. Dans la grande majorité des cas, il est tout à fait légal pour les navires de pêche industrielle d’y pêcher, de prélever de grandes quantités de vie marine, ce qui détruit les habitats, nos stocks de poissons et les moyens de subsistance des pêcheurs locaux», affirme Anna Diski.

Pour Neil Whitney, un pêcheur du sud de l’Angleterre cité par Greenpeace, la pratique revient à «faire passer une moissonneuse-batteuse dans un parc national».

Les chaluts de fond «sont capables de détruire un écosystème entier et s’ils provoquent un tel effondrement, ils ont juste à se déplacer ailleurs», déplore-t-il. «La pêche industrielle (...) est en train de détruire notre environnement marin, et les petits pêcheurs britanniques comme moi sont les grands perdants.»

Selon lui, il est «absurde» que le chalut de fond soit autorisé en zone marine protégée. Ces zones «sont censées permettre aux espèces de se redévelopper», souligne-t-il. «C’est une question de bon sens.»",fr,UK,"Royaume-Uni, Greenpeace, Le Royaume-Uni, la majorité des zones marines protégées du pays.","Will Mccallum, Neil Whitney, Stephen Fry, Simon Pegg, Anna Diski","zone, pêche, fond, zones, greenpeace, navires, blocs, marine, marines, pierre"

Cet amendement, déposé par Pierre Karleskind (Renew, libéraux), était dénoncé par les parlementaires de gauche comme par les ONG environnementales, qui observaient que ces zones ""strictement protégées"" représentent 1% seulement des eaux européennes et sont en principe déjà exemptes d'activités ""néfastes"".

Les défenseurs de l'environnement militaient quant à eux pour que la pêche au chalut soit interdite de toutes les ""aires marines protégées"" (AMP), une catégorie plus large (quelque 10% des eaux européennes). Selon l'ONG Oceana, la pêche au chalut est pratiquée dans 86% d'entre elles. Pour l'ONG Bloom, ce vote a ""méthodiquement saboté l'ambition européenne de protection de l'océan et de la biodiversité"".

La pêche au chalut fournit 80 % du poisson dans les ports français

L'un (361 voix pour, 257 contre) appelle à ""s'attaquer d'urgence aux effets néfastes sur le climat, l'intégrité des fonds marins, les populations piscicoles (...) de moyens de pêche tels que les engins de fond, les filets dérivants (...) en limitant leur utilisation"".

Un autre (361 voix pour, 208 contre), réclame l'interdiction des ""activités industrielles d'extraction, telles que l'exploitation minière, dans les zones marines protégées"". Le troisième vise à identifier les ""habitats marins riches en carbone"" pour les préserver d'activités comme le chalut, susceptible de libérer le CO2 emprisonné.

Bien que non contraignants, ces amendements sont ""une avancée importante"", ""un signal politique fort"" pour la Commission européenne qui doit d'ici l'été présenter ses mesures pour la gestion des mers et la restauration des écosystèmes naturels, estime Nicolas Fournier, de l'ONG Oceana.

Observant que ""le chalut de fond représente 80 % des apports de poissons dans les ports français"", Pierre Karleskind s'est redit opposé à toute interdiction indiscriminée, appelant à le faire ""uniquement là où c'est efficace"", sur avis scientifique, et notant que ""certaines aires protégées le sont pour les oiseaux"".

En cette journée mondiale des océans, le 8 juin, l’association Bloom monte au créneau pour dénoncer un décret gouvernemental. Le texte est sorti en toute discrétion, quelques jours après le premier tour de l’élection présidentielle. Publié le 12 avril au Journal officiel, il était censé concrétiser l’objectif de la loi Climat et Résilience : couvrir 30 % du territoire national par un réseau d’aires protégées, dont 10 % à un niveau « fort ». Plus précisément, le décret devait indiquer les conditions dans lesquelles les espaces terrestres et marins pouvaient être reconnus zones de protection forte.

Mais le texte a été rédigé de façon très ambiguë. « Est reconnue comme zone de protection forte une zone géographique dans laquelle les pressions engendrées par les activités humaines susceptibles de compromettre la conservation des enjeux écologiques sont absentes, évitées, supprimées ou fortement limitées », peut-on y lire. En découvrant la formulation, les membres de l’association Bloom ont manqué de s’étrangler.

« Tel qu’il est rédigé, le texte prévoit un “évitement” ou une “limitation significative” des activités humaines impactantes, et non pas leur interdiction catégorique », dénonce l’organisation de conservation marine dans un communiqué de presse. C’est pourtant une interdiction stricte de ces activités qui devrait être mise en place pour caractériser une aire dite « protégée », d’après les standards internationaux.

« Autrement dit, le décret autorise bel et bien les activités destructrices dans les zones de protection forte », poursuit l’association. C’est pour cette raison que Bloom a déposé le 8 juin un recours gracieux demandant au gouvernement de retirer ce décret. « En l’état actuel [il] représente une menace grave et immédiate pour l’océan et le climat, rend inopérant le concept même de protection marine et amoindrit l’ambition écologique internationale pour l’océan, en créant une définition juridique dans laquelle les industries extractives pourront s’engouffrer », estime l’organisation.

Informer et sensibiliser à leur tour. Certains se sont déjà mis au travail. Au collège de Tipaerui par exemple, plusieurs travaux ont été réalisés, notamment sur le requin marteau. ""On a fait des affiches, sous forme d'exposé"", dit une adolescente.

Un enjeu important pour la France qui compte plus de 10,2 millions de km² d'eaux salées et une initiative qui pourrait être la pierre angulaire d'un traité qui devrait être finalisé lors du sommet de l'ONU sur la biodiversité en décembre à Montréal. Le texte est soutenu par les États-Unis, les pays de l'Union européenne, le Mexique, le Canada, le Japon et l'Inde, mais la Chine, la Russie, l'Indonésie et le Brésil ne l'ont pas encore rejoint.

Des avancées d'autant plus cruciales que la France est particulièrement exposée au réchauffement et à l'acidification des océans. Selon le dernier rapport du Haut Conseil pour le climat (HCC), publié mercredi, la dégradation des coraux, capteurs de CO2 est particulièrement avancée sur près de 60.000 km de récifs et atolls situés dans les trois océans où la France est présente.",fr,"Montréal, Mexique, la Chine, France, la Russie, Canada, Japon, la France","HCC, les États-Unis, les pays de l'Union européenne, le Programme des Nations unies pour l'environnement et la Fondation Ellen McArthur, Haut Conseil pour le climat, l'Organisation mondiale du commerce",,"france, océans, protection, sommet, dernier, accord, pêche, rejoint, changement, climatique"

Labelliser Bullion, village rural du sud des Yvelines en matière de protection des océans. Une idée qui peut, de prime abord, ressembler à une blague. Mais le cœur n’est pas à rire à l’heure où les déchets plastiques polluent le monde marin et sont ingérés par les animaux, notamment les poissons.

« L’océan commence ici, à Bullion »

Derrière cette idée, se cache Mickael Le Saulnier, adjoint en charge de l’environnement à Bullion. « Quand on sait que 80 % de la pollution des océans proviennent de nous, les humains, par ce que nous faisons et consommons », le label concerne toutes les communes de France et pas uniquement celles situées en bord de mer.

« On estime qu’un camion de déchets plastiques est versé dans la mer à chaque minute », souligne l’élu. Ces déchets ont pour conséquence le recul de la biodiversité du monde marin « et donc celui de notre planète ».

« L’océan commence chez nous »

Michaël le Saulnier l’affirme : « L’océan commence chez nous : les eaux de pluie dans les champs, l’eau de la machine à laver, l’eau traitée par la station d’épuration et celles des rivières et des étangs ».

Le label sonne comme une évidence à Bullion, membre du Parc naturel de la haute vallée de Chevreuse. Dans la commune, les projets mis en place depuis deux ans, prennent sérieusement en compte l’écologie.

Les projets se sont succédé : recyclage des mégots, lutte contre les dépôts sauvages, éclairage intelligent, création d’un atlas de la biodiversité, installation d’une fontaine à eau et distribution de gourdes supprimant les bouteilles plastiques. La liste est assez conséquente. Sans oublier dans les prochains mois la création d’une maison de l’abeille et de la biodiversité.

Pas de petits gestes, ni de petites communes

« À travers ce label, nous voulons démontrer que chaque commune, chaque acteur local peut agir concrètement », fait valoir l’adjoint. Et de poursuivre : « 70 % des leviers dans la transition écologique sont locaux ». La signature du label est pour la commune le refus de la fatalité.

Vidéos : en ce moment sur Actu

Le petit village yvelinois « a été la première commune d’Ile-de-France à s’engager pour le label », indique Stéphane Boudy. Deux autres communes ont suivi en Seine-et-Marne. Le président du label rappelle : « On estime à 400 000 000 de tonnes de déchets de présence dans les océans et à 8 000 000 de tonne supplémentaire chaque année ».

Stéphane Boudy remarque : « L’écologie, c’est toujours formidable dans les médias et du point de vue des industriels. Mais sur le terrain c’est très différent, c’est très fataliste ».

Anne Beaugé, marraine du label ajoute : « La pollution marine incombe aux terriens, quels qu’ils soient ». Au fil de ses voyages en mer, la navigatrice a aperçu dans l’eau un frigo ou encore du matériel de pêche.

Les littoraux, eux, regorgent déjà de petits fragments de déchets plastiques. Si les mentalités changent en matière de protection environnementale, notamment par le rapport à la consommation, « le meilleur déchet est celui que l’on ne produit pas ».

Toute la question est de savoir si des engagements concrets sortiront des discussions.

Brest va accueillir le One Ocean Summit du 9 au 11 février prochains, et Emmanuel Macron veut en faire un moment clé de la présidence française du conseil de l'Union européenne.

Ce sommet international va regrouper près de 400 experts et une vingtaine de chefs d'État et de gouvernement. L'idée est d'accélérer l'agenda international pour la protection des océans. 2022 est une année importante car plusieurs rendez-vous internationaux sont d'ores et déjà programmés, pour prendre des mesures en faveur de la protection de la planète bleue.



Dans les prochaines semaines, l'arrêt du plastique sera au coeur de l'assemblée des Nations Unies pour l'environnement, prévue à Nairobi au Kenya. En mars, il y aura des négociations sur la biodiversité au sein même des Nations Unies à New York. Ces rendez-vous se poursuivront avec la COP15 sur la biodiversité, prévue au printemps, à Kunming en Chine, le sommet de l'ONU sur les océans en juin à Lisbonne, et en novembre, la conférence sur les changements climatiques à Sharm el-Cheikh en Egypte.

Un océan en bonne santé, c'est un climat préservé

Catherine Chabaud est profondément engagée dans la protection des océans. L'ancienne navigatrice est aujourd'hui députée européenne et croit à l'action politique pour changer les choses.

""J'attends beaucoup de ce sommet. Ce n'est pas une réunion franco-française, tous les États travaillent et se mobilisent aujourd'hui."" Catherine Chabaud, députée européenne, ancienne navigatrice à franceinfo

Au niveau européen, toute l'attention est portée aujourd'hui sur la mise en oeuvre du pacte vert, ce fameux ""green deal"" qui devrait permettre de faire entendre la voix de l'océan. L'une des priorités aujourd'hui est de financer la restauration des écosystèmes terrestres, mais Catherine Chabaud plaide pour que soit menée une action identique pour les écosystèmes marins : les mangroves, les grandes algues, les herbiers ou les zones humides côtières.



L'ancienne navigatrice reconnaît que certains dossiers ""patinent"" comme le traité sur la haute mer dont l'objectif est de préserver la biodiversité au delà des zones économiques exclusives. ""Actuellement c'est un vide juridique, dit-elle, la lutte contre le plastique est une priorité, mais pas seulement !""



Actuellement, nous rejetons à la mer 11 millions de tonnes de plastique par an, et ce chiffre devrait doubler d'ici 2020. Catherine Chabaud est favorable à la mise en place de mesures contraignantes, mais elle affirme que les choses avancent petit à petit. La France est même un peu en avance, assure-t-elle, grâce à la loi anti-gaspillage et économie circulaire de Brune Poirson, l'ancienne secrétaire d'État à la Transition écologique et solidaire.



Le plastique est un fléau mais la députée européenne estime qu'il faut aussi s'attaquer à la pêche illégale, qui est un autre vrai fléau à travers le monde. Elle souhaite aussi que des mesures soient prises pour la création d'aires marines protégées en Antarctique. Actuellement, les réunions de la commission pour la préservation de la biodiversité marine en Antarctique sont au point mort, car la Chine et la Russie s'y opposent depuis près de 8 ans !

L'océan, bien commun de l'humanité

Depuis son arrivée au parlement européen, Catherine Chabaud et plusieurs scientifiques comme l'océanographe Françoise Gaill, plaident pour que l'océan soit classé ""bien commun de l'humanité"". Elles vont d'ailleurs profiter du ""One Ocean Summit"" pour lancer un appel pour la création d'une ""COP océan"", sur le modèle de la COP pour le climat, afin d'obtenir des objectifs concrets et contraignants pour la protection de l'Océan.

Catherine Chabaud souhaite aussi la mise en place d'un GIEC de l'océan avec le développement d'un jumeau digital de l'océan, qui permettrait d'approfondir notre connaissance des océans grâce à la collecte de données internationales.



Catherine Chabaud estime également qu'il faut que l'on favorise une meilleure gestion des déchets, en particulier ceux qui sont balayés par les eaux pluviales et qui se retrouvent dans l'océan, comme on a pu le constater il y a quelques mois, à Marseille.

L'Europe doit devenir la championne des navires verts

Le transport maritime va devoir évoluer et faire sa mutation. Il faut savoir que 90% des objets de notre quotidien arrivent chez nous par la mer car nous importons beaucoup. Avec l'objectif de neutralité carbone en 2050, le secteur va devoir réduire de 90% ses émissions de CO2, ce qui est considérable.



De nombreuses pistes sont actuellement développées comme la propulsion vélique, mais il faut aller encore plus loin, estime la députée. ""L'Europe à un savoir-faire très important et doit devenir la championne des navires verts"", dit-elle. Et de citer l'exemple d'un bateau qui est actuellement en construction en Europe .""Dans quelques mois, il va transporter les pièces de la fusée européenne Ariane en Guyane"".



La mer est un enjeu stratégique pour l'Europe, estime Catherine Chabaud qui reconnaît que les États et les industriels se mobilisent. L'ancienne navigatrice estime que le One Ocean Summit ne s'adresse pas seulement aux États, qui doivent s'engager au même titre que le monde industriel, les collectivités et les citoyens.",fr,"La France, Kenya, Lisbonne, Marseille, L'océan, Kunming, Sharm el-Cheikh, Nairobi, Brest","l'assemblée des Nations Unies pour l'environnement,, COP, Sommet international sur l'océan du 9 au 11 février à, COP15, États, GETTY IMAGES, des Nations Unies à New York, Ariane en Guyane, franceinfo, DIEGO NIGRO / EFE, conseil de l'Union européenne","Moment Rf, Françoise Gaill, Brune Poirson, Catherine Chabaud, Brett Garner, Emmanuel Macron, David Photography","l'océan, catherine, chabaud, protection, européenne, mer, sommet, international, février, océans"

Conférence de l'ONU à Lisbonne : la protection des océans, un enjeu local

Tahiti, le 28 juin 2022 – Le ministre de la Culture, de l’Environnement et des Ressources marines, Heremoana Maamaatuaiahutapu, participe en ce moment à la Conférence de l’ONU sur les océans, qui se tient jusqu’à vendredi à Lisbonne, au Portugal. Au cours des deux premiers jours, il a notamment rencontré d’autres leaders du Pacifique ainsi que des représentants de peuples autochtones afin d’échanger autour de la protection et la gestion durable des océans.



Le ministre de la Culture, de l’Environnement et des Ressources marines, Heremoana Maamaatuaiahutapu, est actuellement en déplacement à Lisbonne, au Portugal, dans le cadre de la Conférence de l’ONU sur les océans, qui s’est ouverte lundi matin. “Co-organisée par les gouvernements du Kenya et du Portugal, cette seconde conférence de la décennie des océans de l’ONU rassemble de nombreux chefs d’État et de gouvernement, des décideurs et des experts, des organisations non gouvernementales et de la société civile, sur la thématique de la protection et la gestion durable des océans”, explique par voie de communiqué le gouvernement de la Polynésie française.



En attendant son allocution en séance plénière, le ministre a participé à plusieurs événements parallèles afin de “porter le message des Polynésiens en faveur de la protection de notre océan”. Lundi, il a rencontré le Dr Bruno Oberle, directeur général de l’Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature (IUCN). Cette dernière est “l’une des principales organisations non gouvernementales mondiales consacrées à la conservation de la nature. Sa mission est d’influencer, d’encourager et d’assister les sociétés du monde entier, dans la conservation de l’intégrité et de la biodiversité de la nature, ainsi que de s’assurer que l’utilisation des ressources naturelles est faite de façon équitable et durable”. Ils ont ainsi pu discuter de l’éventualité d’un partenariat autour “de la lutte contre les techniques de pêche impactantes, interdites dans notre zone économique exclusive, mais largement utilisées dans les eaux internationales”.



Lors de rencontres informelles avec d’autres leaders du Pacifique, Heremoana Maamaatuaiahutapu a également traité de la question des échanges et de la coopération régionale, avec notamment le Premier ministre des Fidji, Ratu Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, et le président de la République des Palaos, Surangel Whipps Jr.



Le lendemain, le ministre polynésien a été invité à s’exprimer au cours d’une rencontre avec des représentants des peuples autochtones “organisée par la Société pour la nature et les parcs du Canada, organisme de bienfaisance qui se consacre à la protection des terres publiques, des eaux intérieures et des océans dans le respect de la souveraineté et du leadership des nations autochtones”. L’occasion pour Heremoana Maamaatuaiahutapu de rappeler “l’importance des connaissances et des savoir-faire traditionnels dans la bonne gestion de nos espaces et de nos espèces”.

Ce mercredi 9 février marque l’ouverture à Brest de cette conférence internationale, qui se tient pendant trois jours dans le cadre de la présidence française de l’Union européenne et qui vise à s’intéresser à la protection des océans. Elle sera le premier d’une série d’événements internationaux sur cette thématique, avant la tenue d’une réunion de l’ONU sur l’environnement fin février pour aborder la question d’un accord international sur le plastique, des négociations en mars à l’ONU sur un traité pour la haute mer, des COP biodiversité et climat et une conférence de l’ONU sur les océans à Lisbonne en juin.

La suite après la publicité

Ces derniers occupent 70 % de la surface du globe et jouent un rôle essentiel dans la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique. Ils nourrissent les populations et abritent de nombreuses espèces. Pourtant, « ces dernières décennies, les progrès en matière de conservation marine n’ont pas été à la hauteur des enjeux », souligne dans une tribune publiée dans « le Monde » un collectif de 19 ONG œuvrant pour la protection des écosystèmes marins.

Avancer sur la protection de la haute mer

A Brest, où la Chine et la Russie brillent par leur absence, plusieurs points sont à l’ordre du jour. La France devrait d’abord annoncer l’extension de la réserve marine des Terres australes et antarctiques françaises sur un million de kilomètres carrés, dont une zone de protection forte de 250 000 km². Cette extension permettra au pays de remplir son objectif de 30 % de protection annoncé pour cette année.

De grandes avancées sont par ailleurs attendues des associations en ce qui concerne la protection de la « haute mer ». Alors que les eaux internationales représentent 64 % de l’océan mondial et un peu plus de la surface de la planète, elles ne font l’objet d’aucune protection. Au niveau global, de 1 % à 2 % seulement de ces eaux sont protégées.

Depuis 2019, des négociations sont en cours aux Nations unies pour formaliser un traité international pour la conservation et l’utilisation durable de la biodiversité marine en haute mer, grâce notamment à la création d’un réseau d’aires marines protégées. « La France et les chefs d’Etat présents à Brest doivent exprimer leur soutien entier à la conclusion d’un traité fort, ambitieux et juridiquement contraignant pour les eaux internationales en 2022 », réclame le collectif. Cet accord doit être finalisé lors d’une conférence organisée par l’ONU du 27 au 1er juillet.

Lutter contre la pollution plastique

Actuellement vice-présidente de l’Assemblée des Nations unies pour l’Environnement, la France devrait également plaider en faveur d’un traité international contraignant sur la pollution plastique. L’assemblée environnement de l’ONU pourrait lancer des négociations sur un tel accord courant février.

Mardi 8 février, le WWF a alerté sur ce problème : dans un rapport, l’association conclut que la pollution plastique a atteint « toutes les parties des océans » et menace la biodiversité marine « du plus petit plancton à la plus grosse baleine ».

Cette contamination « a atteint toutes les parties des océans, de la surface aux grands fonds marins, des pôles aux côtes des îles les plus isolées, et se retrouve du plus petit plancton à la plus grosse baleine ». Car entre 19 et 23 millions de tonnes de plastiques arrivent chaque année dans les eaux de la planète, dont une bonne partie finissent en mer.

Un danger croissant, même si le WWF reconnaît un manque de données sur d’éventuelles répercussions sur les humains de cette présence de produits aux composants chimiques. Les produits sont pour une bonne part des plastiques à usage unique, que de plus en plus de pays interdisent mais qui constituent toujours plus de 60 % de la pollution marine. Ils se dégradent au fur et à mesure de leur séjour dans l’eau, jusqu’à devenir des « nanoplastiques ».

En clair, même si plus aucun plastique n’arrivait dans l’océan, le nombre de microplastiques devrait y être multiplié par deux d’ici 2050. Or, selon les estimations citées par le WWF, la production de plastique dans le monde devrait doubler d’ici 2040.

Deux grands absents : le chalutage de fond et la surpêche

Le programme s’annonce chargé mais la coalition d’ONG pour la conservation des eaux profondes s’inquiète des velléités de la France à explorer les fonds marins à plus de 4 000 mètres de profondeur. Mal connus, ces fonds contiennent d’importantes ressources minières. En septembre, l’Union internationale pour la Conservation de la Nature (UICN) a adopté un moratoire sur leur exploitation, que la France n’a pas soutenu.

Les ONG appellent par ailleurs Emmanuel Macron à se positionner en faveur d’un moratoire sur l’exploration en eaux profondes, soutenu par 37 gouvernements mais aussi de grands groupes comme Google ou BMW, lors du Congrès mondial de la Nature de septembre dernier.

« Le président de la République a prévu 310 millions d’euros de financement pour l’exploration des ressources minérales des grands fonds marins dans le cadre du plan France 2030 », s’alarme France Nature Environnement. Et selon les calculs de l’association Oceana, les aires marines « protégées » d’Europe ont fait l’objet de plus de 2,5 millions d’heures de chalutage de fond en 2020.

« Les fonds marins doivent être sanctuarisés, pas exploités ni détruits », interpelle pour sa part FNE dans un communiqué de presse. En les labourant pour en extraire des minerais précieux, « des espèces marines et des écosystèmes fantastiques seraient menacés, et du carbone s’échapperait des profondeurs, affolant encore un peu plus le climat », complète Greenpeace.

Plus généralement, les associations de protection de l’environnement regrettent que certaines questions essentielles, comme la surpêche, n’aient pas été mises à l’agenda. Si la France espère que de nouveaux pays ratifieront l’accord du Cap, destiné à renforcer la sécurité des navires de pêche et à lutter contre la pêche illégale, seulement 2,8 % de la surface de l’océan est à ce jour véritablement protégée des effets de la pêche. « L’exploitation minière en eaux profondes semble imminente, la pêche industrielle continue d’être fortement subventionnée par les gouvernements et les plastiques sont devenus omniprésents dans les eaux du globe », regrettent plusieurs associations environnementales dans « le Monde ».",fr,"Brest, Lisbonne, la France","BMW, Congrès mondial de la Nature, UICN, WWF, la Chine et, l’Union internationale pour la Conservation de la Nature, Greenpeace, FNE, l’ONU, La France, la réserve marine des Terres australes et antarctiques françaises, France Nature Environnement, « le Monde », ONG, Brest, Nations unies, Oceana, Google, les associations de protection de l’environnement regrettent",Ailleurs Macron,"protection, la, france, plastique, vidéo, conservation, mer, marine, surface, biodiversité"

L'acteur Jason Momoa, qui a notamment incarné Aquaman sur grand écran, était présent : ""Les océans ont besoin de nous"", a t-il rappelé, avant d'ajouter : ""sans un océan sain, notre planète comme nous la connaissons n'existerait pas.""

Il a été rejoint par le président portugais, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, qui a lancé un avertissement aux jeunes générations.

""Pour être écouté et avoir un impact sur le climat ou les océans, vous devez vous battre et gagner pour vous-mêmes. Ne comptez pas trop sur les gouvernants. Il y a des exceptions. Certains d'entre eux sont et seront toujours vos principaux alliés, mais pas la majorité"".

Le secrétaire général de l'ONU, Antonio Guterres, était également présent. Il a prononcé un discours de mea culpa : ""Permettez-moi de commencer en suivant les mots du président portugais, pour présenter des excuses au nom de ma génération à votre génération en ce qui concerne l'état des océans, l'état de la biodiversité et l'état du changement climatique.""

Essentiels à notre survie, les océans et les espèces qui y vivent sont particulièrement menacés par le réchauffement climatique et les activités humaines, comme la sur-pêche ou la pollution plastique. Autre conséquence : l'acidification des eaux, dues aux quantités de C02 émises dans l'atmosphère, qui perturbe et menace les écosystèmes marins.

Durant cette rencontre, des gouvernements et sociétés ont pris plusieurs engagements importants.



Protéger 30 % des terres et mers du monde

Lors de l’édition 2021 du One Ocean Summit, trente nouveaux pays ont rejoint la Coalition de la Haute Ambition pour la Nature et les Peuples. Désormais, pas moins de 84 pays en font partie. Comme l’expliquait Novethic dans un article du 11 février 2022, le premier objectif de cette coalition est de protéger environ un tiers des terres et des mers du monde d’ici 2030. Durant l’édition 2022 qui s’est déroulée à Brest, une quarantaine de pays ont signé un ambitieux traité sur la Haute Mer.

La France se veut exemplaire et a déjà annoncé avoir dépassé ce seuil de 30 % pour son propre territoire. Récemment, la réserve naturelle nationale des Terres australes françaises a été étendue. Avec plus de 1,5 million de km², il s’agit désormais de la seconde plus importante aire marine protégée en termes de superficie. Via la Polynésie française, notre pays s’est également engagé à protéger tous les coraux et établir une aire marine protégée d’au moins 500 000 km².

Réduire la pollution plastique et la pêche illégale

Le One Ocean Summit a également été l’occasion de s’engager en faveur de la réduction de la pollution plastique et de la pêche illégale. La Clean Oceans Initiative disposera de quatre milliards d’euros d’ici 2025 grâce à l’Agence française de développement et la Banque européenne d’investissement. Par ailleurs, la France et l’Inde ont lancé une initiative commune concernant la fin de la pollution engendrée par les plastiques à usage unique. Évoquons également un engagement mondial pour une nouvelle économie des plastiques intéressant de nouveaux pays comme la Grèce, la Corée du Sud, la Colombie et l’Italie.

Au niveau de la pêche illégale, l’Accord du Cap adopté en 2012 devrait entrer en vigueur cette année et a également observé la signature de six nouveaux pays. L’objectif ? Lutter indirectement contre la pêche illicite et fixer de nouvelles normes de sécurité pour les navires de pêche. Un autre accord concerne un meilleur contrôle des activités de pêche au niveau des ports. Renforcer la surveillance de la pêche illégale sera par ailleurs un des objectifs de plusieurs pays de l’UE qui mobiliseront leur marine.

Changement climatique, pollution de l’air et connaissance des océans

Les autres engagements pris lors du dernier One Ocean Summit concernent le changement climatique, la pollution atmosphérique et la connaissance des fonds marins. Le nouveau label Green Marine Europe a reçu la candidature de 22 armateurs européens avec pour objectif de réduire les émissions de GES et d’améliorer le recyclage des navires. Une vingtaine de ports de première importance ont également affirmé vouloir limiter les émissions et la pollution de l’air en accélérant la fourniture d’électricité aux navires en escale. Une autre initiative lancée par la France et le Brésil consistera à restaurer des écosystèmes côtiers en s’appuyant sur le principe de la compensation carbone.

Pour ce qui est de la connaissance des fonds marins, l’UNESCO a annoncé un projet de cartographie d’au moins 80 % des fonds marins d’ici 2030. Actuellement, ce taux est de seulement 20 %. Cette organisation estime que ces données peuvent permettre de planifier une exploitation durable des ressources naturelles, d’identifier les sites à protéger, de prévenir les risques de catastrophes naturelles et technologiques, et planifier la construction d’infrastructures maritimes.",fr,"La France, Brest, Bretagne","la Coalition de la Haute Ambition pour la Nature et les Peuples, la Colombie, La Clean Oceans Initiative, l’Agence française de développement, GES, Green Marine Europe, la Banque européenne d’investissement, la France, la Haute Mer, la Polynésie française, le Brésil, l’UNESCO, la Grèce, la Corée du Sud, la réserve naturelle nationale des Terres australes françaises a été",,"pays, pollution, ocean, summit, pêche, la, marine, illégale, engagements, nouveaux"

Cet organisme a été retenu par notre directeur technique Aldo Senbati, très sensibilisé par la protection des océans et qui nous explique pourquoi:

‘Les océans ont longtemps été considérés comme une source inépuisable où l’on peut tout prendre et aussi où l’on peut tout jeter.

La preuve est faite que les océans montrent des signes de fatigue dûs à la surexploitation et aussi au dérèglement climatique.

Si les océans n’arrivent plus à absorber les gaz comme le CO2, les ressources vont rapidement disparaître et donc un milliard de personnes dans le monde ne trouveront plus de quoi manger.

Heureusement qu’ à notre époque il est toujours possible d’entreprendre des actions pour sauver des centaines d’espèces marines et rendre cette étendue d’eau propre comme jadis.’

Nous comptons sur vous et sur votre soutien, d’avance nous vous en remercions!

C’était une première mondiale, et elle restera dans les annales. Du 9 au 11 février, des centaines de spécialistes, mais aussi des représentants de nombreux Etats du monde entier se sont réunis au chevet des océans, depuis les Ateliers des Capucins de Brest. Trois jours de travail en commun, pour créer une dynamique mondiale visant à sauver la mer d’un naufrage annoncé.

« Le temps est à l’action »

Vendredi 11 février, en clôture du sommet, François Cuillandre, maire de Brest, n’y est pas allé par quatre chemins : « La communauté internationale nous le dit haut et fort, les océans sont au cœur de l’avenir de notre terre. Ils sont au cœur du dérèglement climatique. Ils sont en danger, mais ils sont aussi à la source des solutions. Le temps n’est plus au constat mais à l’action ».

Le matin, les bénévoles de l’association Wings of the Ocean se sont adonnés à une collecte des déchets sur la plage aux côtés d’une quarantaine d’employés de Suez, ainsi que de volontaires recrutés sur la promenade. Le ramassage a duré quarante-cinq minutes. Puis, place au tri, afin d’évaluer la quantité et la composition des objets polluants. « En moins d’une heure, nous avons collecté 4 600 mégots, une soixantaine de capsules, des plastiques en tout genre », détaille Claire, l’une des bénévoles.

L’objectif : nettoyer mais aussi sensibiliser. « Le public est toujours très surpris de toutes les ordures ramassées, y compris dans une station balnéaire qui a plutôt les moyens comme Lacanau. Notre but est de faire prendre conscience de la quantité de déchets que l’on rejette au quotidien, présents dans toutes les étapes de notre consommation », explique Camilo, également bénévole. Des polluants aux chemins multiples : laissés sur la plage ou rejetés dans la mer, notamment via les égouts.

Certains sont d’ailleurs invisibles, mais ont des conséquences sur notre santé : c’est contre eux que se bat l’association Water Family, en charge de la protection de l’eau. « Aujourd’hui, lorsqu’on parle de qualité de l’eau, on se réfère à la bactériologie, en oubliant les millions de micropolluants chimiques qui ne sont pas totalement éliminés par les stations d’épuration, et sont rejetés à la mer. Ils présentent un danger sanitaire à long terme », explique Marion Thenet, responsable de Water Family.

L’association veut donc agir à la source, en incitant les foyers à utiliser des produits ménagers et cosmétiques moins polluants, ou à économiser l’eau « invisible », nécessaire à la production des produits du quotidien, comme l’alimentation ou les vêtements, en consommant moins et mieux. Elle a installé son stand au Caraïbos Lacanau Pro, avec jeux et panneaux informatifs.

Les océans sont pollués, Patrick Deixonne, le savait en se lançant dans sa traversée de l'Atlantique à la rame, mais ce qu'il a vu a dépassé l'entendement. Une véritable mer de plastique grossit, au large, causant la mort de nombreuses espèces animales et végétales. Un fléau contre lequel chacun peut agir, de manière bien plus directe qu'on ne peut l'imaginer.

Il fait beau, on flâne au bord du canal à Agen, on grille une petite cigarette et en écrase le mégot au sol, un geste loin d'être anodin malheureusement encore trop observé. Il suffit d'un coup de vent pour que ce mégot tombe dans l'eau et nous le savons tous, mais nous avons sûrement un peu de mal à l'assimiler... les petits cours d'eau font les grandes rivières, et toutes se jettent à la mer.

Apprendre l'importance du tri, de manière ludique

C'est ce que l'équipe de la péniche Naïade entend rappeler au cours de son tour de France qui fera escale à Agen du 5 au 8 mai. En effet, ""80% des déchets plastiques retrouvés dans les océans viennent de la terre. Protéger l’océan, ça s’apprend, et ça commence par les fleuves !"", assure Citeo et Expedition 7e continent, les organisateurs de cette ""tournée pédagogique"".

À chaque étape, des stands de sensibilisation sont installés aux abords de la péniche, pour sensibiliser à l'importance du tri et rendre plus concrète la réalité des ""microparticules"" qui envahissent les océans et empoisonnent les poissons. ""Le week-end, les visiteurs, familles, grand public pourront visiter les stands, observer les microparticules au microscope, participer aux animations “La Longue Vie des Déchets” ou “La Roue du tri” et poser toutes leurs questions.

→ RELIRE. Climat : les océans, régulateurs thermiques, se mélangent moins

Une vingtaine de chefs d’État et de gouvernement – la liste n’a pas été dévoilée – sont attendus. La France promet des annonces « concrètes » pour vendredi. L’objectif : donner une impulsion politique aux négociations internationales sur la protection des océans, qui patinent au niveau de l’ONU.

Six rendez-vous internationaux

Une série de six rendez-vous sont prévus en 2022 sur la réglementation des eaux internationales, la limitation du plastique à usage unique ou encore la surpêche. « Nous pouvons interrompre le déclin si nous parvenons à un consensus avant la fin de l’année », ose croire Peter Thomson, envoyé spécial du secrétaire des Nations unies pour l’océan, présent au sommet.

→ TRIBUNE. « Comment les baleines et les océans peuvent nous aider à lutter contre le réchauffement climatique »

En priorité, la négociation d’un traité mondial pour protéger la haute mer, dont le prochain tour de négociations est prévu à l’ONU en mars. L’enjeu sera de trouver des règles pour protéger les eaux internationales, peu régulées, qui constituent 60 % des océans. « Les scientifiques recommandent de protéger 30 % des océans, la haute mer doit donc pouvoir être réglementée, explique Liz Karan, de l’ONG Pew Trusts. Il ne s’agit pas seulement d’une étendue vierge : on y trouve des écosystèmes nécessaires à la fabrication de l’oxygène par les océans ou encore de nombreux coraux. »

Protéger la haute mer

Les pays cherchent à s’accorder depuis une dizaine d’années sur la meilleure façon de protéger ces eaux, souvent apparentées à un « Far West ». En pratique, certaines espèces sont déjà gérées par des organismes de pêche régionaux, à l’instar des thons de l’Atlantique. Mais faute de mécanisme juridique, il est impossible d’y créer des aires protégées.

« Il faudrait pour cela mettre en place une instance décisionnaire, c’est-à-dire une conférence des parties (COP), comme il en existe pour le climat », explique Julien Rochette, directeur du programme Océan à l’Iddri (Institut du développement durable et des relations internationales). Les ONG craignent que les négociations aboutissent à un traité a minima, sans mesures concrètes qui permettraient une limitation de la surpêche ou du transport maritime dans ces zones protégées.

Que peut le sommet One Ocean ? « Il faudrait que les chefs d’État présents s’engagent en faveur d’un mécanisme contraignant et envoient des ministres à l’ONU lors des négociations de mars », et pas seulement des techniciens, plaide François Chartier, chargé du plaidoyer sur les océans chez Greenpeace.

De nouvelles aires marines protégées

Vendredi, le président de la République devrait aussi annoncer la création de nouvelles aires marines protégées, cette fois dans les eaux françaises. En 2021, la France s’était engagée à protéger au moins 30 % de ses espaces maritimes d’ici à 2022, dont 10 % sous protection forte. À ce jour, celles-ci ne couvrent que 23,5 % des eaux françaises et la protection forte, 1,6 %.

À lire aussi Limites planétaires, limites scientifiques

Le même jour, plusieurs ONG environnementales françaises appellent à manifester pour dénoncer « l’ambiguïté » de Paris sur ces questions. « L’exécutif affiche un volontarisme sur le plan international avec cet objectif de 30 %, pointe François Chartier. Mais il envoie des signaux contradictoires, en investissant par exemple dans l’exploration des océans. » Dans le cadre du plan de relance, 2 milliards d’euros ont été débloqués à cette fin. Les ONG de protection de l’environnement craignent que celle-ci ouvre la voie à une exploitation future des ressources, notamment minières, dommageable pour les écosystèmes.

Projet de décret controversé

Elles critiquent aussi un projet de décret mis en consultation en janvier, qui définit le périmètre des aires de protection forte comme une « zone géographique dans laquelle les pressions engendrées par les activités humaines susceptibles de compromettre la conservation des enjeux écologiques de cet espace sont évitées, supprimées ou significativement limitées ». Une définition insuffisante, selon elles, pour éviter la pêche industrielle dans ces zones.

Outre les aires protégées, les chefs d’État et de gouvernement doivent se prononcer sur la création d’un traité mondial sur le plastique, discuté fin février à l’ONU.

--------

La protection des eaux françaises

Il n’existe pas de définition nationale ou internationale d’une aire marine protégée. La notion peut couvrir la réserve intégrale à l’équivalent des parcs naturels français, où les activités extractives sont permises.

La majorité des aires marines protégées françaises se trouvent dans les territoires ultramarins. Celles des Terres australes françaises et de Nouvelle-Calédonie représentent près de 90 % des zones de protection françaises.

Les ONG environnementales plaident pour que les objectifs de protection de 30 et 10 % (voir ci-dessus) s’appliquent à chaque façade maritime, pour mieux protéger les eaux métropolitaines.",fr,"Paris, Brest, France","Océan à l’Iddri, COP, l’ONG Pew Trusts, Greenpeace, Institut du développement durable et des relations internationales, Les ONG de protection de l’environnement, One Ocean, Celles des Terres australes françaises et, l’ONU, Les ONG environnementales plaident, ONG","La Mer, Julien Rochette, François Chartier, Liz Karan, Emmanuel Macron, Peter Thomson","protection, océans, françaises, internationales, plan, sommet, négociations, traité, haute, mer"

À quelques jours de la deuxième Conférence de Haut niveau sur l’Océan, la femme d’affaires et philanthrope suisse Dona Bertarelli, Remi Parmentier du Varda Group, Romain Troublé de la Fondation Tara Ocean et Puri Canals de l’ONG MedPAN livrent leurs propositions pour protéger les océans et proclament leur optimisme.

Voici leur tribune. #OceanOptimism – C’est le hashtag que vous allez voir sur vos écrans dans les prochains jours. Du 27 juin au 1er juillet, les Nations unies organisent à Lisbonne la deuxième « Conférence de Haut niveau sur l’Océan ». Objectif : examiner les progrès de la mise en œuvre de l’Objectif du Développement Durable (ODD 14) entièrement dédié à la protection de l’océan et identifier les obstacles qui demeurent afin de les éliminer.

Lire aussi - EXCLUSIF. Le prince Albert II de Monaco au JDD : « Pour les océans, il faut agir, et vite ! »

Il peut paraitre paradoxal de parler d’optimisme si l’on sait que la pérennité de la vie marine ne tient qu’à un fil : proportion des stocks de poissons surexploitée qui est passée de 25 % à 34 % au cours de deux dernières décennies, pollution par les déchets plastiques que l’on retrouve dans notre alimentation et dans nos organes vitaux sous forme de particules micro-plastique, pollution aux métaux lourds, aux résidus des pesticides organochlorés, aux ruissèlements d’engrais agricoles et aux pertes de déchets radioactifs.

Et comme si cela ne suffisait pas, le changement climatique s’accompagne d’un changement océanique sous diverses formes : réchauffement de la température, modification de la composition chimique de l’océan, changement des courants océaniques et des mouvements migratoires des poissons, transformation de la géographie planétaire dans les zones insulaires et côtières en raison particulièrement de la fonte des glaces polaires et des glaciers qui ne fait que commencer...

Et ce n’est pas tout ! On convoite aussi les ressources minières du sous-sol marin dont l’exploitation pourrait causer des dommages irréparables à des écosystèmes vulnérables et à des espèces marines dont nous soupçonnons à peine l’existence.

C’est en réponse à ce panorama peu réjouissant que la conférence onusienne de Lisbonne rassemblera près de 18 000 défenseurs de l’océan. Comme il y a exactement trente ans le premier Sommet de la Terre, à Rio de Janeiro, avait enclenché un mouvement - trop lent mais historique - en faveur du climat et de la biodiversité, les éditions successives des Conférences des Nations unies sur l’Océan devraient devenir des « Sommets de la Mer ».

La protection de l’océan comme norme et non plus comme exception

Évidemment, reste le risque d’un « phénomène disque rayé » inhérent à ces grandes messes. Pour dépasser cette impasse, nous avons entrepris une réflexion collective intitulée De la Matière à Méditer à la Matière à Agir, du nom d’un essai publié il y a quelques mois à l’occasion de la Monaco Ocean Week. Les fruits de cette réflexion collective seront publiés à l’ouverture de la conférence de Lisbonne. Au menu, une réflexion qui se veut radicale, pour donner un coup d’accélérateur dans différents processus qui peinent à livrer concrètement des mesures de protection.

Plutôt que de nous battre pour convaincre de la nécessité de la création d’aires marines protégées, pourquoi ne pas faire l’inverse en laissant les exploitants se battre pour obtenir des licences dans des aires marines exploitables ? Du coup, ce qui ne serait pas « exploitable » serait protégé par définition.

Dès que le contexte géopolitique le permettra, convoquer un Sommet sur la Vie en Antarctique en vue de la protection intégrale de l’océan Austral.

Réformer la gestion des très grands poissons (thons, espadons, requins, merlins, légines australes) par exemple en adoptant des limites numériques plus faciles à contrôler et non des quotas basés sur leur poids approximatif.

Approfondir et mettre en œuvre sans délai l’élimination des subventions contribuant à la surpêche et la surcapacité décidée tout récemment par l’Organisation mondiale du Commerce (OMC).

Traiter les micro-plastiques de la même façon que les déchets radioactifs.

Établir des organisations régionales de gestion de l’océan, pour superviser les organisations sectorielles (gestion des pêcheries, du trafic maritime, etc.) et prendre en compte le maintien de la vie des écosystèmes marins dans leur ensemble.

Il y a déjà sept ans cette année que les ODD visant la mise en œuvre du développement durable d’ici à 2030 furent adoptés par l’Assemblée générale de l’ONU. Il ne reste donc plus que sept ans avant la date butoir de 2030. Alors que nous traversons cette année l’équateur de cette course, il est temps d’accélérer.

C'est une conférence des Nations unies où la France se doit de faire entendre sa voix. Emmanuel Macron, à la tête du pays détenteur du deuxième domaine maritime mondial, doit s'exprimer ce jeudi après-midi au sommet mondial sur les océans qui se tient toute cette semaine à Lisbonne. Une immensité (plus de 70 % de la surface du globe) dont la protection est essentielle pour la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique. Les océans absorbent un quart du CO 2 rejeté dans l'atmosphère.

La France, avec ses plus de 10,2 millions de km² d'eaux salées, est exposée en première ligne à leur dégradation. Celle des coraux, ces capteurs de CO 2 répartis sur près de 60.000 km de récifs et d'atolls dans les trois océans où elle est présente, est déjà très avancée, selon le rapport que le Haut Conseil pour le climat (HCC) vient de remettre à la Première ministre Elisabeth Borne .

Dans les territoires ultramarins les plus densément peuplés des Antilles et de l'Océan Indien, 62 % des coraux sont dégradés, pointent ses auteurs. Dans ceux du Pacifique, 70 % sont en bonne santé.

Des océans en état de surchauffe

Cette surchauffe des mers participe à une situation qu'Antonio Guterres, le secrétaire général des Nations unies, a qualifiée à Lisbonne « d'état d'urgence des océans ». D'autres causes nourrissent cette crise des espaces marins contre lesquelles la communauté internationale commence à se mobiliser.

Face à la pollution plastique, un accord mondial juridiquement contraignant s'esquisse. Les pays membres du G7, qui viennent de se réunir à Elmau (Allemagne), ont décidé d'accélérer les discussions et une réunion de négociations doit se tenir au second semestre de cette année. Les mêmes se sont engagés à soutenir l'adoption cette année d'un accord contraignant pour la protection de la haute mer.

Lutte contre la pêche illicite

En matière de protection de la biodiversité, la coalition de pays lancée en février dernier par la France à l'occasion du One Ocean Summit de Brest pour préserver 30 % de leurs espaces terrestres et maritimes se renforce. Quelque 84 Etats se déclarent aujourd'hui partants sur cet objectif. La lutte contre la pêche illicite fait des progrès. L'Organisation mondiale du commerce (OMC) vient de parvenir à un accord interdisant de subventionner cette pratique .

Au sommet de Lisbonne, un dernier dossier, sensible pour la France, est « monté à la surface », celui de l'extraction minière en eaux profondes. Le gouvernement de la République des Palaos, Etat insulaire de Micronésie, a annoncé son opposition à l'exploitation minière dans les abysses et le lancement d'une nouvelle « Alliance des pays pour un moratoire contre l'exploitation minière des océans ».

Une circulaire qui dérange les ONG

L'initiative est bien perçue par les petits pays du Pacifique qui redoutent les conséquences de l'extraction de métaux rares sur les fonds marins et leurs ressources. « La Commission européenne s'est déjà prononcée pour une pause mais pas encore les Etats membres », signale la députée européenne écologiste Marie Toussaint. La France n'a pas rejoint le mouvement et les ONG s'en inquiètent.

« Emmanuel Macron a refusé d'adhérer à l'appel lancé, en septembre dernier à Marseille, au congrès de l'Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature », regrette un représentant de Greenpeace France. Il redoute que Paris ne fasse un tout autre choix, en rappelant qu'en mai dernier, le gouvernement avait sorti une circulaire sur la stratégie nationale d'exploration et d'exploitation des ressources minérales dans les grands fonds marins .

Leur immensité ne les protège plus depuis longtemps. Les océans, qui couvrent plus de 70 % de la surface du globe, sont en bien mauvaise santé et c'est à leur chevet que l'Union européenne se porte du 9 au 11 février à Brest, sous l'égide de sa présidence française. Un grand corps malade sur lequel va se pencher une conférence internationale, le One Ocean Summit, annoncée l'automne dernier par Emmanuel Macron, lors du congrès de l'Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature (UICN).

Une vingtaine de chefs d'Etats et de gouvernement, mais aussi moult scientifiques, acteurs économiques et représentants d'organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) seront là, les uns en distanciel, les autres en présentiel, pour examiner et faire avancer les remèdes qui sont à l'étude, mais aussi savoir comment mieux connaître ce fragile organisme et accélérer son exploration en vue d'une exploitation future. L'exercice s'annonce difficile car il faut en même temps s'accorder à ne pas l'épuiser en s'entendant sur une gestion durable de ses ressources.

Signe qu'il y a urgence, les rendez-vous internationaux consacrés aux océans, en tout ou en grande partie, auront rarement été aussi nombreux que cette année. Ce One Ocean Summit précède tout d'abord de quelques semaines un nouveau round de négociation, que les experts veulent croire décisif, sur le futur traité de gouvernance de la haute mer , dans les limbes depuis plusieurs années.

De grandes puissances absentes

L'enjeu des discussions qui se tiendront fin mars à New York, au sein des Nations unies, est capital. Il s'agit de faire enfin sortir de sa situation de non droit absolu une zone qui couvre rien moins que 60 % de la surface maritime terrestre. Un milieu dont il est encore possible de prélever les richesses minières et halieutiques sans avoir aucunement à en rendre compte.

En ce sens, le sommet de Brest revêt un rôle assez crucial. Particulièrement son segment de haut niveau, le 11 février, pour lequel sont annoncés des dirigeants politiques de premier plan, dont Ursula von der Leyen, la présidente de la Commission européenne. Il permettra d'évaluer les chances de voir aboutir ce futur « accord sur la biodiversité par-delà les juridictions nationales ».

« La France et les pays de l'UE disent vouloir obtenir un traité ambitieux. A Brest, il faut qu'ils se mettent en position de taskforce pour peser dans les négociations », plaide-t-on à Greenpeace France. Pour autant, le One Ocean Summit pourra difficilement lever toutes les incertitudes, très loin s'en faut. Les dirigeants de plusieurs grandes puissances maritimes, comme l'Australie, n'y seront pas.

Une situation handicapante pour faire avancer d'autres sujets urgents comme le futur traité international contraignant sur la pollution des mers par les plastiques . La France, actuellement vice-présidente de l'Assemblée des Nations unies pour l'environnement (ANUE), travaille avec acharnement pour qu'un vote d'adoption puisse intervenir courant février à Nairobi, où siège cette institution internationale.

Impasse sur la surpêche

Tout comme Paris plaide pour que soit bien pris à la 15e Conférence internationale sur la biodiversité, la COP15, prévue fin avril à Kunming (Chine), l'engagement de placer 30 % des océans d'ici 2030 sous la protection d'aires marines. Les rangs de la coalition en faveur de cette haute ambition , dont elle a pris la tête avec le Costa Rica et qui compte plus de 60 pays, pourraient s'élargir à ce One Ocean Summit que les ONG déplorent vivement de voir faire l'impasse sur toutes les problématiques liées à la surpêche .

Un autre enjeu sera d'y rendre définitivement opérationnelle la déclaration de Torremolinos (Espagne) de 2019 dans laquelle 51 Etats se sont engagés à ratifier, avant le dixième anniversaire de son adoption, l'accord du Cap de 2012. Celui-ci fixe des normes mondiales de sécurité aux navires de pêche et, ce faisant, contribue à la lutte contre la pêche illégale. Mais le deal passé par l'Organisation maritime internationale (OMI) attend encore la ratification de six pays pour entrer en application.

« J'espère que nous aurons à Brest ces engagements », s'est émue la semaine dernière Annick Girardin, la ministre de la Mer, lors de la présentation du One Ocean Summit. Ce n'est pas le seul défi à relever. « Il faut accélérer l'effort de verdissement du transport maritime », a également plaidé la ministre. Et de préciser qu'elle « espérait pouvoir entraîner à Brest de grands armateurs européens dans une démarche vertueuse de labellisation ». Les quatre majors européens du transport par conteneur que sont CMA-CGM, Maersk, Hapag-lloyd et MSC sont pressentis pour en faire l'annonce, vendredi, en présence d'Emmanuel Macron.

Pour autant, ils restent mal connus et mal protégés : comment préserver les océans ? C'est l'ambition du sommet qui s'ouvre ce mercredi à Brest, en France.

Durant trois jours, des tables-rondes rassembleront experts, militants et entreprises. Vendredi, une quinzaine de chefs d'état et de gouvernements sont attendus. Objectif : donner un coup d'accélérateur sur plusieurs dossiers cruciaux.

Parmi ceux-là : la création d'un traité international destiné à protéger la haute mer. Cette zone, située à 200 milles nautiques des côtes, ne se trouve sous la juridiction d'aucun Etat.

Les négociations formelles de ce futur texte, commencées en 2018 mais interrompues par la pandémie, portent sur quatre domaines: la création d'aires marines protégées, les ressources génétiques marines et le partage de leurs avantages, la réalisation d'études d'impact environnementales, ainsi que le renforcement des capacités et les transferts de technologies notamment vers les pays en développement.

Olivier Poivre d'Arvor, ambassadeur des pôles et des enjeux maritimes, est l'organisateur de ce premier ""One Ocean Summit"". ""Si nous ne faisons rien, pas dans un siècle mais dans 10 ans, 600 millions de personnes auront les pieds dans l'eau. Si nous ne faisons rien dans 80 ans, en 2100, les prévisions du GIEC sur l'élévation du niveau de la mer qui sont d'un mètre cinquante seront largement dépassées et on sera à plus de 2 mètres et là ce sera deux, trois milliards d'habitants qui seront vraiment submergés"", explique-t-il.

Les ONG espèrent des annonces fortes à Brest tout en regrettant déjà que des questions aussi cruciales que la surpêche ne soient pas à l'ordre du jour. Ce rendez-vous sera le premier d'une série d'autres événements internationaux consacrés aux mers et aux océans dans les prochains mois.

A la veille de l'ouverture du sommet, le WWF a publié un nouveau rapport détaillant et alertant sur les ravages de la pollution plastique. Selon l'ONG, ce type de pollution va quadrupler si rien n'est fait d'ici 2050.

Mais seulement 1% de la haute mer est actuellement protégée. D’où la nécessité de trouver rapidement un accord.

Et c'est vraiment là que se trouve le grand combat, pour s'assurer que nous créons un réseau de sanctuaires océaniques qui restaureront les populations épuisées, protégeront la biodiversité et donneront à nos océans une chance de se battre pour survivre à des choses comme le changement climatique, la pollution plastique et la pêche.""

Le départ est prévu entre le 4 et le 6 septembre 2022, en fonction de la meilleure fenêtre météo.

A N N O N C E

Au total, Rémi Camus a prévu de nager 180 km entre Calvi et Monaco – soit huit heures de nage chaque jour, la traversée devrait lui prendre entre 8 et 15 jours – le tout équipé d’une combinaison, et en tractant une plateforme de 130 kg qui lui permettra de passer ses nuits.

L’objectif de l’éco-aventurier n’est pas uniquement sportif et dépasse la nage. Son projet, theNEXTexploration a plusieurs objectifs : la sensibilisation à l’environnement, d’une part et la recherche scientifique, d’autre part. En collaboration avec le CHU de Grenoble, il va travailler sur le stress en milieu hostile.

Pour mettre au point ce projet, il lui a fallu deux ans de préparation, entre l’étude de la faisabilité, la recherche de partenaires, mais aussi la mise au point physique avec des entraînements de six à sept jours par semaine. Une préparation physique en salle de sport, mais aussi en nageant en rivière ou encore en s’isolant dans son congélateur pour travailler sa résistance au froid.

À côté de cela, il y a eu aussi deux entraînements particuliers. En août 2021, il a fait le tour du Lac Léman en partant d’Évian-les-Bains, 180 km de nage déjà en tractant une plateforme. Et l’hiver dernier, Rémi souhaitait descendre la Saône de Villefranche-sur-Saône jusqu’à la Méditerranée à la nage, mais les autorités ont estimé que la sécurité n’était pas assurée. Il a donc finalement réalisé des boucles tous les jours dans la même portion, près de Villefranche-sur-Saône dans une eau glacée.

L'un des moyens d'y parvenir consiste à combler le manque de connaissances et le déficit émotionnel au sein du grand public à l'égard des océans.

""Si les océans n'existaient pas, le changement climatique serait bien pire""

Alan Deidun nous explique en quoi l'information des citoyens est cruciale pour remplir ces objectifs environnementaux. ""On oublie souvent que chaque bouffée d'air qui entre dans nos poumons vient des océans : plus de 50 % de l'oxygène que nous respirons provient des océans, il faut avoir cela en tête,"" insiste-t-il.

""Les océans absorbent également une grande partie du dioxyde de carbone et des autres gaz à effet de serre que nous rejetons dans l'atmosphère en brûlant des combustibles fossiles,"" poursuit-il, ""donc s'ils n'existaient pas, le changement climatique serait bien pire et les concentrations de CO2 seraient plus élevées dans notre atmosphère.""

""Quand on sensibilise à ces questions, les gens sont mieux informés,"" assure l'ambassadeur de l'océan pour Malte. ""On commence à changer leur manière de penser et donc, leurs comportements pour les inciter à incarner eux-mêmes le changement,"" souligne-t-il.

Le succès de la science citoyenne

""À Malte, il existe un outil que je trouve efficace, c'est la science citoyenne,"" renchérit Alan Deidun. ""Cela consiste à impliquer et former différents acteurs : plaisanciers, plongeurs, pratiquants de snorkeling, baigneurs... On leur demande de s'investir pour collecter des données scientifiques sur la mer,"" indique-t-il.

Il y a rarement eu un tel sommet, avec des chefs d’État, sur les enjeux des océans. Rien que pour cela, il est intéressant. C’est un lieu de débats, d’échanges et, j’espère, de soutien plus politique. La protection de la mer n’est pas technique, elle est politique. Mais il manque la volonté politique.

Quelles décisions politiques doivent être prises ?

Il faut que les États signent la fin de la récré sur plein de sujets, qu’ils s’accordent sur un traité, pas dans trois ans, mais dès cette année. Cela fait dix ans que les juristes et les techniciens négocient un accord sur la haute mer. Il faut désormais une prise de position politique. Concernant la protection de certaines zones en Antarctique, des projets se heurtent à des refus de signer de deux pays : la Russie et la Chine. Pour qu’ils signent, il faut trouver des compromis sur d’autres sujets avec eux. C’est en ce sens que c’est politique.

On voit la pollution partout. Le plastique en mer, c’est une catastrophe.

Quels sont les risques s’il n’y a pas de décision rapide ?

Chaque jour qui passe, la mer, ses écosystèmes et ses stocks sont de plus en plus sous pression, notamment car on ne régule pas certaines pêches. Il faut absolument arrêter certaines pêches ravageuses. Si on altère trop certains écosystèmes, on ne les retrouvera jamais. Il faut faire ces choix de société le plus vite possible. Cela ne peut plus attendre.

Quels types de pêche faut-il arrêter ?

Le chalut détruit les habitats. Si les pêcheurs vont toujours au même endroit, c’est moins grave. Par contre, s’ils vont dans de nouveaux endroits, les chaluts emportent tout l’habitat avec et toutes les espèces en pâtissent. Ce sont des choses dont nous, terriens, on ne se rend pas forcément compte…

Qu’observez-vous avec Tara ?

On voit la pollution partout. Le plastique en mer, c’est une catastrophe. Il faut un traité sur la gestion des plastiques à l’échelle internationale. On parle de nettoyer les océans mais ce n’est pas ça le sujet. C’est comme avec les émissions de CO2, il faut arrêter d’en répandre plus dans l’atmosphère. Le plastique, il faut arrêter de le mettre dans la mer et dans la nature en général. Le plastique implique tout le monde. Cela ne peut pas être fait seulement en France ou en Europe. Ce sont des sujets internationaux.

Il est difficile de mettre tout le monde d’accord. Êtes-vous toujours optimiste ?

On n’a pas le choix d’être optimiste. Pour essayer de gagner une bataille, il faut penser qu’on va la gagner. Je suis toujours très optimiste mais il faut prendre des bonnes décisions et rendre ces sujets bien plus politiques.

Je me désole du manque de sujets environnementaux dans le débat présidentiel. Très peu de politiques en parlent. Cela doit pourtant être un débat de société. Notre santé en dépend.

165,2022-06-29,Protection des océans : « Moins de 10 ans pour renverser la tendance »,https://up-magazine.info/planete/biodiversite/104213-protection-des-oceans-moins-de-10-ans-pour-renverser-la-tendance/,26,25,1,0,up-magazine.info,France,"A la Conférence des Nations Unies pour l’océan en juin 2022, la Directrice générale de l’UNESCO a appelé la communauté internationale à renforcer au plus vite ses actions « pour mieux comprendre et mieux protéger les océans ». L’humanité a dix ans devant elle pour comprendre que la Terre est d’abord et avant tout un océan. « Notre destin dépend de la façon dont nous en prenons soin, ensemble. »

A Lisbonne, Audrey Azoulay, Directrice générale de l’UNESCO, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Président du Portugal, et Uhuru Kenyatta, Président du Kenya, ont réuni l’Alliance de la décennie pour l’océan. Instaurée à l’occasion de la Décennie des sciences océaniques pour le développement durable (2021-2030) conduite par l’UNESCO, cette instance permet d’accroître la coopération internationale en matière de recherche, d’éducation et de protection des océans. « Grâce à cette Alliance, nous avons déjà réuni 920 millions de dollars, qui financent une centaine d’actions », a salué Audrey Azoulay en ouverture de cette réunion. « Mais l’essentiel du chemin reste à faire. L’océan est encore trop souvent dans l’angle mort des consciences et des politiques publiques. Nous ne le comprenons pas et nous ne le protégeons pas suffisamment. Il y a urgence à renverser radicalement la tendance […] L’humanité a 10 ans devant elle pour comprendre que la Terre est d’abord et avant tout un océan. », a-t-elle appelé devant les dirigeants publics et les partenaires du secteur privé.

Mieux comprendre, mieux protéger

La Directrice générale de l’UNESCO pose comme première priorité de « faire progresser l’état des connaissances ». La recherche océanographique ne pèse en moyenne que 2% des budgets nationaux de recherche, tandis que seuls 21% des fonds marins sont cartographiés. Ces données sont pourtant essentielles pour comprendre les courants, recenser les ressources halieutiques ou identifier les risques géologiques. L’UNESCO s’est engagée à l’action internationale dans ce domaine. Elle vise qu’au moins 80% des fonds marins soient cartographiés d’ici 2030. Le projet de cartographier en haute résolution au moins 80% des fonds marins d’ici 2030, par le biais du programme Seabed 2030 de la Carte générale bathymétrique des océans, permet une collaboration entre l’UNESCO et l’Organisation hydrographique internationale (OHI), avec le soutien spécial de la Nippon Foundation, la plus grande fondation privée du Japon.

Deuxième priorité : mieux protéger l’océan. « Cela implique d’augmenter rapidement la surface des aires marines bénéficiant de mesures de sauvegarde », prône Audrey Azoulay. Grâce aux sites du patrimoine mondial de l’UNESCO, 20% des réserves mondiales de carbone bleu sont déjà protégées : des récifs coraliens, des mangroves ou encore des herbiers qui contribuent à limiter le dérèglement climatique en stockant massivement le CO2.

L’UNESCO compte aussi plus de 210 000 km² de zones de biosphère : un programme imaginé dans les années 70, alors pionnier du développement durable, qui repose sur un équilibre entre l’homme et son environnement. Dans le même esprit, l’Organisation sauvegarde des traditions et des savoir-faire autochtones qu’il est important de transmettre aux jeunes générations, notamment en matière de pêche durable.

Moins de 2% des budgets de la recherche investis dans les sciences océaniques

La disponibilité et l’allocation de fonds en faveur des sciences océaniques continuent de varier considérablement selon les pays et les régions mais, dans l’ensemble, le financement des sciences océaniques semble remarquablement faible par rapport à de nombreux autres domaines de recherche et d’innovation. En moyenne, seul quelque 1,7% du total des dépenses intérieures brutes en recherche et développement a été consacré aux sciences océaniques en 2017, cette part s’échelonnant entre 0,03% environ et 11,8% au Pérou, pays leader en la matière, suivi de l’Afrique du Sud (5,6 %), de l’Irlande (5,3%), de la Norvège (4,4 %) et du Portugal (3,5%).

L’éducation pour clef de voûte

« Mais pour que ces actions aboutissent et que nous parvenions à des résultats tangibles, nous devons aussi embarquer avec nous toute la société. C’est le rôle majeur de l’éducation. », a rappelé Audrey Azoulay.

L’initiation à l’océan est définie comme « une compréhension de l’influence de l’océan sur vous et de votre influence sur l’océan ». Il faut donc soutenir les institutions de recherche océanique du monde entier dans le renforcement de l’engagement du public et l’intensification de l’initiation à l’océan afin que nous puissions tous mieux comprendre les mesures à prendre pour préserver la santé de nos océans. Le Portail d’initiation à l’océan de l’UNESCO est un guichet unique mondial qui fournit des ressources et des contenus à tous, dans le but de créer une société sensibilisée à l’importance de l’océan, qui soit capable de prendre des décisions éclairées et responsables en matière de ressources océaniques et de durabilité de l’océan.

Le 10 février dernier à Brest (France), lors du One Ocean Summit, Audrey Azoulay a annoncé l’engagement de l’UNESCO à « inclure l’éducation relative à l’océan dans les programmes scolaires de ses 193 États membres d’ici à 2025 ». Afin d’atteindre cet objectif, l’UNESCO a remis aux gouvernements un kit pour l’éducation relative à l’océan, qui contribuera à promouvoir à l’avenir une nouvelle relation plus durable entre les humains et l’océan.

Elle développe aussi des campagnes mondiales de sensibilisation, à l’image de « Génération Océan », dont la surfeuse brésilienne Maya Gabeira est devenue lundi la porte-parole en étant désignée Ambassadrice de Bonne Volonté de l’UNESCO.

Des exemples d’éducation à l’océan ont déjà fonctionné. Tels que le projet SeaBeyond, mené en collaboration par le Groupe Prada et l’UNESCO, un programme éducatif de sensibilisation à la durabilité de l’océan à l’intention des établissements du secondaire. Plus de 300 élèves de dix pays ont participé au premier cycle du projet, un concours de campagnes de sensibilisation à l’océan développées par les élèves pour leurs camarades.

Lors d’une cérémonie de remise des prix en ligne, le projet gagnant a été annoncé : un court dessin animé intitulé Redes circulares : Cerco ao plástico no mar (« Filets circulaires : Une mer de plastique »), montrant la pollution plastique catastrophique qui met en danger les écosystèmes océaniques et la manière de collecter les déchets plastiques pour les recycler. Il a été développé par l’école portugaise « Agrupamento de Escolas de Vialonga » à Vialonga (Lisbonne).

La deuxième place a été remportée par la division internationale du lycée de Shanghai (Chine), avec un jeu de société, Environopoly, qui vise à apporter à la fois divertissement et connaissances environnementales aux élèves.

Venait ensuite le Colegio Latino, à Villahermosa, au Tabasco (Mexique), avec une campagne intitulée « Sea Beyond », consacrée à l’impact des microplastiques sur l’océan.

Prada a attribué 5 000 euros à l’école gagnante, pour investir dans des matériels pédagogiques sur l’environnement, et les trois premières campagnes ont été diffusées sur les réseaux sociaux du Groupe et de l’UNESCO.

C’est dans les océans que toutes les formes de vie sont apparues : ils abritent 157 000 espèces connues et jusqu’à un million d’autres qui restent à découvrir. Sans eux, la Terre ne pourrait pas respirer, car ce poumon bleu absorbe un quart des émissions mondiales de dioxyde de carbone. De plus, 3 milliards de personnes, soit près de la moitié de l’humanité, dépendent directement d’eux pour assurer leur subsistance. Aujourd’hui, pourtant, l’avenir des océans est menacé. Le changement climatique fait sentir ses effets : les eaux se réchauffent et s’acidifient, les écosystèmes souffrent. Au cours des 200 dernières années, la planète a perdu la moitié de sa couverture corallienne et les trois quarts de ses forêts de mangroves. D’après un rapport de l’UNESCO, les océans pourraient bientôt cesser d’absorber du carbone et commencer à en émettre, ce qui serait pour le moins catastrophique. Nous ne pouvons pas relever ces défis si nous continuons de méconnaître les océans. À ce jour, seulement 20% de leurs fonds ont été explorés, alors qu’ils couvrent 71% de la surface de la planète. La recherche océanographique reste mal financée, ne recevant qu’une part infime des budgets nationaux de la recherche (moins de 2% en moyenne). Parce que le monde a les océans en partage, ce n’est qu’au moyen du multilatéralisme que nous y parviendrons. À l’heure où les humains ont les yeux rivés sur Mars, nous devons explorer les océans, continent le moins connu du globe. Nous devons redoubler d’efforts pour comprendre ces profondeurs, afin de pouvoir apporter des solutions durables aux menaces qui pèsent sur elles. Ce n’est qu’au moyen du multilatéralisme que nous y parviendrons. L’UNESCO œuvre à l’accomplissement de cet objectif. Grâce à sa Commission océanographique intergouvernementale, qui compte 150 États membres, et à ses compétences dans les domaines de la culture et de l’éducation, l’Organisation coordonne les actions des gouvernements, des scientifiques, du secteur privé, de la société civile et d’autres institutions du système des Nations Unies. Ensemble, nous avons créé le système d’alerte aux tsunamis, nous cartographions les eaux abyssales, identifions des espèces, faisons en sorte que l’éducation à l’environnement et l’initiation à l’océan soient intégrées dans les programmes scolaires, et protégeons le patrimoine subaquatique. L’UNESCO est également le gardien de sites océaniques exceptionnels par la biodiversité formidable qu’ils abritent, par leurs particularités géologiques ou par leur beauté incomparable. Nous comptons actuellement 232 réserves de biosphère marine et 50 sites marins du patrimoine mondial de valeur universelle exceptionnelle dans le monde. Il reste cependant beaucoup à faire. Pour lutter contre la désinformation et privilégier les analyses qui décryptent l’actualité, rejoignez le cercle des lecteurs abonnés de UP’ je choisis mon abonnement Aujourd’hui, l’UNESCO cherche à amplifier cette mobilisation collective en faveur des océans dans le cadre de la Décennie des Nations Unies pour les sciences océaniques au service du développement durable, qui a débuté en 2021 et s’achèvera en 2030. Dans ce contexte, plusieurs grands sommets internationaux auront lieu cette année, ce qui démultipliera les efforts que nous déployons pour mieux comprendre – et donc mieux protéger – l’océan. Audrey Azoulay

Il est essentiel de connaître la profondeur et le relief des fonds marins pour comprendre l’emplacement des failles océaniques, le fonctionnement des courants marins et des marées, ainsi que le transport des sédiments.

Ces données contribuent en effet à la protection des populations car elles permettent d’anticiper les risques de séisme et de tsunami, d’identifier les sites naturels à sauvegarder et les ressources halieutiques à exploiter durablement. Elles sont nécessaires pour planifier la construction d’infrastructures en mer et pour réagir efficacement aux catastrophes telles que les marées noires, les accidents d’avion et les naufrages. Elles jouent également un rôle majeur dans l’évaluation des effets futurs du changement climatique, qu’il s’agisse de l’augmentation des températures ou de l’élévation du niveau de la mer.

166,2022-02-07,Protection des océans : qu'attendre du One Ocean Summit qui se tient à Brest cette semaine ?,https://www.consoglobe.com/one-ocean-summit-cg,24,19,5,0,consoglobe.com,France,"L’océan est au centre de toutes les inquiétudes des écologistes et des défenseurs de la planète : les humain les détruisent de plus en plus, à cause de la surpêche notamment. Mais alors que le premier sommet mondial dédié à l’océan se prépare en France, à Brest, il est déjà critiqué : l’exploitation des océans pourrait continuer, en étant juste un peu mieux régulée. Insuffisant pour certains, alors que l’océan est riche de biodiversité et aide à lutter contre le réchauffement climatique.

One Ocean Summit : vers des engagements forts pour la protection de l’océan ?

L’exploitation de l’océan a été une nouvelle fois au centre des débats sur les réseaux sociaux début février 2022 lorsque les photos de milliers de poissons morts au large de La Rochelle, en France, ont été publiées par l’association Sea Shepherd. Des poissons morts à la suite du passage du deuxième chalutier le plus grand du monde, le Margiris, et de trois autres navires(1).

Une polémique qui est née ironiquement quelques jours seulement avant le One Ocean Summit qui se tiendra du 9 au 11 février 2022 à Brest. Les pays participants sont attendus de pied ferme par les associations environnementales : ils doivent prendre des engagements en amont de la signature d’un traité à New York, en mars 2022.

﻿

Plusieurs questions sont sur la table : surpêche, zones maritimes protégées pour garantir la biodiversité, pollution plastique, mais aussi l’exploitation minière des fonds marins en eau profonde pour laquelle un moratoire a été signé en septembre 2021 durant le Congrès mondial de la nature, mais pour lequel la France s’est abstenue.

La crainte d’un sommet pour rien

Emmanuel Macron, au contraire, veut continuer l’exploration des océans, ce qui fait craindre le pire aux associations de défense de la planète. Surtout que les océans sont peu protégés : seulement 7,7 % se situent dans une aire marine protégée, dont seulement 2,8 % bénéficient d’une protection renforcée. Or, en septembre 2020 un objectif de 30 % d’océans protégés avait été fixé.

Dans ce contexte de frilosité des pouvoirs publics et face au risque de voir les océans surexploités comme les terres avant eux, l’association Soulèvements de la Mer a tenu son contre-sommet le week-end du 6 février 2022. « De nouvelles méthodes de législation et d’exploitation des océans s’annoncent, qui continueront à mettre en péril toutes les vies qui s’organisent hors des systèmes de production de masse », juge le collectif de lutte citoyenne.

""La mobilisation d'aujourd'hui a permis de concrétiser beaucoup d'engagements, des coalitions nouvelles d'acteurs privés et publics, d'États"", a estimé Emmanuel Macron en conclusion du sommet One Ocean Summit qui s'est déroulé à Brest. Les dirigeants politiques qui se sont succédé dans le Finistère, présents ou en vidéo, se sont engagés sur plusieurs dossiers, dont des avancées vers des traités mondiaux de protection de la haute mer et contre la pollution du plastique. Parmi les présents, la présidente de la Commission européenne Ursula von der Leyen, l'émissaire américain pour le climat John Kerry, ou encore le président portugais Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, qui accueillera fin juin un sommet de l'ONU sur les océans à Lisbonne. D'autres dirigeants sont intervenus par messages vidéo.

""Si nous nous en donnons les moyens, nous pouvons prendre des décisions historiques, il faut que ça commence aujourd'hui, à Brest"", a martelé le président français, Emmanuel Macron. Principal progrès, Ursula von der Leyen a annoncé depuis Brest le lancement d'une coalition comptant les 27 Etats membres de l'UE et 13 autres pays pour conclure un traité destiné à protéger la haute mer, qui n'est sous la juridiction d'aucun Etat.

Une conclusion des négociations prévue pour 2022

Des négociations, en cours sous l'égide de l'ONU depuis 2018, ont été interrompues par l'épidémie de Covid-19. La quatrième et théoriquement dernière session de négociations est prévue en mars à New York. ""Nous sommes très proches mais nous devons donner de l'impulsion pour le conclure cette année"", a insisté la dirigeante européenne. ""Il s'agit d'un engagement important et providentiel"", a salué Peggy Kalas de la High Seas Alliance, qui rassemble plusieurs ONG.

Les Etats-Unis ont annoncé pour leur part soutenir le lancement de négociations sous l'égide de l'ONU pour un accord international contre la pollution du plastique. Les Etats-Unis rejoignent ainsi une dizaine de pays et l'ensemble de l'Union européenne. Le lancement de ces négociations sera examiné lors de la 5e Assemblée des Nations Unies pour l'environnement fin février, afin d'aboutir à un accord international contre la pollution provoquée par les 8,3 milliards de tonnes de plastiques produits depuis les années 1950.

""Nous avons besoin d'un accord qui assure le plus haut niveau d'ambition possible"", a réclamé John Kerry. Le président de Polynésie française, Edouard Fritch, a annoncé vendredi le projet d'une ""aire marine protégée de plus de 500.000 km2"" et des zones réservées à la pêche côtière sur une surface équivalente. D'autres sujets ont été abordés, comme la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre du secteur maritime, qui n'est pas concerné par l'Accord de Paris sur le climat. Ou encore, comme l'a réclamé Emmanuel Macron, la suppression des subventions publiques encourageant la surpêche et la pêche illicite, sujet en cours de discussion à l'Organisation mondiale du commerce. Il a aussi promis d'en faire plus pour protéger les tortues avec des dispositifs évitant qu'elles restent coincées dans les filets.

Des ONG dubitatives sur la capacité à protéger les océans

La présidente d'honneur du WWF France Isabelle Autissier a salué cette annonce, tout en ""restant vigilant sur la mise en oeuvre réelle de cette promesse"". Pour des ONG, la France, deuxième puissance maritime mondiale, n'est pour autant pas à la hauteur pour bien protéger ses mers et océans. Environ 150 personnes se sont rassemblées vendredi matin à Brest à l'appel de Greenpeace et de l'association Pleine mer pour dénoncer ""une opération de blue washing"". Emmanuel Macron ""annonce qu'il est le champion des océans et qui derrière ne fait rien, voire défend des activités industrielles extrêmement destructrices"", a déploré auprès de l'AFP François Chartier, de Greenpeace France. ""On a très peu parlé de surpêche, on n'a pas parlé de choses fondamentales, sur une protection effective et réelle des aires marines protégées (...) On est passés complètement à coté du sujet"", a commenté Lamya Essemlali, présidente de Sea Shepherd France, à l'AFP.

Une fois son périple terminé, il commence à chercher d’où provient tout le plastique retrouvé à la surface de l’eau mais surtout ce qu’il devient. ""En menant l’enquête, je me suis aperçu qu’un drame se déroulait et qu’il n’était pas du tout mis en avant auprès du grand public"", alerte l’explorateur qui se transforme alors en lanceur d’alerte.

Des animations pour une prise de conscience

Avec son équipe, il souhaite sensibiliser le grand public mais surtout les plus jeunes. Pour cela, et pour la 5e édition, il organise une tournée pédagogique à bord d’une péniche qui, depuis le 29 avril et jusqu’au 4 juin, navigue de Fourques-sur-Garonne à Toulouse.

Tel était l’objectif fixé au One Ocean Summit lorsqu’Emmanuel Macron en avait lancé l’idée, le 3 septembre dernier, lors d’un déplacement à Marseille.

« Ce sommet international doit permettre d’imaginer des initiatives en matière de recherche, en matière de juridiction internationale et essayer de bâtir ou de compléter ce droit international qui nous permettra de protéger l’espace océanique », avait imaginé le chef de l’État.

Un grand retard a été pris d’une part parce que « la mer n’abritant pas d’électeur, il n’y a pas de pression politique sur les questions maritimes alors que les enjeux sont énormes pour l’avenir », remarque Olivier Poivre d’Arvor, l’ambassadeur français pour les pôles et les enjeux maritimes, qui a mis sur le pied le One Ocean Summit.

L’autre raison est que les océans sont avant tout « des espaces contestés », comme l’a rappelé le ministre des Affaires étrangères Jean-Yves le Drian, le 28 janvier, lors d’une table ronde au Quai d’Orsay consacrée au sommet de Brest.

« C’est-à-dire des espaces de fortes tensions, des espaces de rivalités stratégiques entre États (…) et des espaces d’intenses compétitions économiques, puisque la mondialisation est d’abord et avant tout une maritimisation massive de nos échanges commerciaux et de nos chaînes de valeur. »

La gouvernance des océans au centre des discussions

Le secrétaire général de l’Onu, Antonio Guterres, a donné son aval à cette déclinaison « Ocean » du concept des One Planet Summit, lancé, en 2017, par la France. Le principe sera d’annoncer des engagements précis de la part d’entreprises et d’une vingtaine de chefs d’État, avec, en particulier, une implication forte de la Commission européenne.

Ils doivent permettre d’inscrire un agenda international, de créer des coalitions en amont des réunions internationales, sous l’égide de l’Onu, pour espérer y décrocher un accord.

Toute une série de sujets seront couverts à Brest : la protection des écosystèmes et la promotion d’une pêche durable, la lutte contre la pollution, notamment plastique, la lutte contre le changement climatique et le verdissement du transport maritime ; la gouvernance rénovée des océans.

C’est ce dernier sujet qui sera au centre des discussions. Si l’exploitation des fonds marins est réglementée depuis 1982 par l’accord de Montego Bay?, la biodiversité de la colonne d’eau en haute mer n’est, elle, toujours pas protégée.

Cette zone, qui se situe au-delà des 200 milles nautiques (370,4 km) des côtes, représente 60 % des surfaces maritimes et 45 % de la surface du globe. Elle n’est régie que par le principe de libre navigation.

Les participants du One Ocean Summit devront s’engager clairement sur le sujet pour que les négociations internationales, prévues en mars à New York, puissent déboucher sur un accord international. Celui-ci pourrait être scellé lors du sommet de l’Onu sur les océans, en juin, à Lisbonne.

Des engagements attendus contre la pollution plastique

Des engagements en faveur de la lutte contre la pollution plastique sont également annoncés. Certes, ils ne devraient pas venir des majors du pétrole et de la chimie, dont les productions polluent la colonne d’eau et tapissent le fond des océans, mais plutôt des États, en particulier concernant le plastique à usage unique.

« Nous rejetons 11 millions de tonnes de plastique dans les océans et ce chiffre va doubler d’ici à 2030 si rien n’est fait », avait mis en garde, le 28 janvier, Peter Thomson, envoyé spécial du secrétaire général des Nations unies pour l’océan.

La France et d’autres pays soutiennent la mise en œuvre d’un traité international à force obligatoire, qui empêchera la pollution plastique. Le traité sera négocié à la fin du mois, lors de l’Assemblée des Nations unies pour l’environnement, à Nairobi?.

Un accord à ratifier pour la sécurité des marins

Du côté d’Annick Girardin, on insiste sur la nécessité d’un cadre international protecteur pour les marins, avec des normes plus ambitieuses pour la sécurité à bord des navires. « C’est tout le sens de la mobilisation en cours pour faire, enfin, aboutir la Convention de Torremolinos et pour ratifier l’Accord du Cap, a déclaré la ministre de la Mer, le 28 janvier.

Si ces instruments ne sont pas ratifiés d’ici la fin de l’année 2022, 10 ans après leur signature, alors ils ne pourront plus entrer en vigueur. Nous sommes actuellement dans une phase critique. » À ce jour, seuls 16 États ont ratifié l’accord.

Après plus de 15 années de discussions informelles puis formelles pour élaborer un texte contraignant visant à sauvegarder cette vaste zone qui couvre près de la moitié de la planète, cette 5e session devait être la dernière, comme devait déjà l'être la 4e en mars. Mais, malgré des discussions qui ont débordé dans la soirée de vendredi, cela n'a pas suffi.

« Nous n'avons jamais été aussi proches de la ligne d'arrivée dans ce processus », a relevé la présidente de la conférence Rena Lee, relevant d' « excellents progrès ». Mais « nous avons encore besoin d'un peu de temps », a-t-elle ajouté, recueillant l'approbation de la plénière pour suspendre les travaux sine die. L'Assemblée générale de l'ONU va désormais être saisie de la demande de reprendre cette 5e session à une date qui reste à déterminer.

Le Pacifique reste mobilisé

« Malgré la déception de ne pas avoir finalisé le traité, nous jugeons encourageants les progrès réalisés », a commenté Liz Karan, de l'ONG Pew Charitable Trusts, appelant à une nouvelle session d'ici la fin de l'année. Greenpeace s'est montré plus sévère, accusant notamment les États-Unis et les pays de la Coalition pour une haute ambition, emmenées par l'UE, d'avoir attendu le dernier moment pour faire preuve de cette ambition « autoproclamée ». Trop tard : « Le temps est écoulé », a dénoncé Laura Meller, responsable Océans de l'ONG.

« Pendant que les pays continuent à parler, les océans et ceux qui en dépendent souffrent », a-t-elle ajouté dans un communiqué. Par exemple les États insulaires en développement du Pacifique. En leur nom, la représentante de Samoa, Matilda Bartley très émue, a exprimé sa « déception ». « Nous vivons très loin et cela coûte cher de venir jusqu'ici (...) De l'argent qui n'est pas dépensé pour des routes, des médicaments, des écoles ». « Le Pacifique est venu ici en toute bonne foi et continuera à le faire jusqu'à ce que nous concluions cette conférence dans un avenir proche », a-t-elle lancé au bord des larmes, sous les applaudissements de la salle.

Parmi les sujets les plus contentieux, la répartition des possibles bénéfices issus de l'exploitation des ressources génétiques de la haute mer, où industries pharmaceutiques, chimiques et cosmétiques espèrent découvrir des molécules miraculeuses. Répondant aux demandes des pays en développement qui craignent de passer à côté de retombées potentielles faute de pouvoir conduire ces recherches coûteuses, le dernier projet de texte laisse sur la table la redistribution initiale de 2% - et à terme jusqu'à 8% - des futures ventes de produits issus de ces ressources qui n'appartiennent à personne. Mais sans accord.

« Opportunité ratée »

Ces questions d'équité Nord-Sud traversent de nombreuses négociations internationales, en particulier celles sur le climat où les pays en développement victimes mais pas responsables du réchauffement réclament en vain aux pays riches de respecter leurs promesses d'aide financière. Ce futur traité vise spécifiquement la haute mer qui commence où s'arrêtent les zones économiques exclusives (ZEE) des États, à maximum 200 milles nautiques (370 km) des côtes, et qui n'est donc sous la juridiction d'aucun pays.

Alors que la bonne santé des écosystèmes marins est cruciale pour l'avenir de l'humanité, notamment pour limiter le réchauffement de la planète, seulement 1% de cet espace, qui représente 60% des océans, est protégé. Un des piliers du traité sur « la conservation et l'utilisation durable de la biodiversité marine des zones ne relevant pas de la juridiction nationale » est d'ailleurs d'y permettre la création d'aires marines protégées.

« Une étape cruciale dans les efforts pour protéger au moins 30% de la planète d'ici 2030 », avait souligné cette semaine Maxine Burkett, une responsable pour les océans au département d'État américain. Certains experts craignent que sans accord sur le traité sur la haute mer d'ici la fin de l'année, cet objectif soit hors d'atteinte. Les délégations s'opposent aussi toujours sur le processus de création de ces aires protégées, ainsi que sur les modalités d'application de l'obligation d'études d'impact environnementales avant une nouvelle activité en haute mer.

« Quelle opportunité ratée... » a regretté sur Twitter Klaudija Cremers, chercheuse à l'Institut du développement durable et des relations internationales (IDDRI).

175,2022-06-28,"La CAF va allouer 1,25 milliard de dollars à la protection des océans d'Amérique latine et des Caraïbes",https://atalayar.com/fr/content/la-caf-va-allouer-125-milliard-de-dollars-la-protection-des-oceans-damerique-latine-et-des,11,9,2,0,atalayar.com,France,"Lors de la Conférence sur les océans à Lisbonne, la CAF, la banque de développement d'Amérique latine, a annoncé qu'elle allouera 1,25 milliard de dollars au cours des cinq prochaines années pour financer des projets qui contribuent à préserver, dynamiser et stimuler les écosystèmes marins et côtiers en Amérique latine et dans les Caraïbes.

Les ressources seront utilisées pour concevoir et mettre en œuvre des projets visant à promouvoir l'économie bleue, en mettant l'accent sur la restauration des environnements marins et côtiers, le carbone bleu, les énergies marines renouvelables, la pêche et l'aquaculture durables, la gestion côtière intégrée, les solutions fondées sur la nature, le paiement des services écosystémiques, l'écotourisme et l'amélioration de la gestion des zones marines protégées, notamment.

Aujourd'hui, les océans sont confrontés à de graves problèmes de durabilité, principalement causés et accélérés par le changement climatique, tels que des eaux de plus en plus acides et chaudes, l'élévation du niveau des mers et la surexploitation des stocks marins. En Amérique latine et dans les Caraïbes, les écosystèmes marins présentent une réduction de l'abondance, de la densité et de la couverture des stocks de coraux et de poissons, des changements dans le plancton et la perte de zones humides végétalisées.

""Ce financement réaffirme notre engagement à mener la lutte contre le changement climatique et le développement de l'économie bleue en Amérique latine et dans les Caraïbes. Grâce à ces ressources, nous mettrons en œuvre des solutions innovantes qui contribueront à atténuer les effets du réchauffement climatique, à renforcer la préservation des écosystèmes marins et à améliorer les conditions de vie des millions de Latino-Américains qui dépendent des océans"", a déclaré Sergio Díaz-Granados, président exécutif de la CAF.

Les ressources destinées à protéger les océans font partie de l'objectif de la CAF de devenir la banque verte de l'Amérique latine et des Caraïbes. En ce sens, lors de la COP26 à Glasgow, l'institution a annoncé un financement de 25 milliards de dollars dans des opérations vertes qui permettent d'accroître la résilience climatique, de préserver la biodiversité, de promouvoir la transition énergétique et d'atteindre une croissance à faible émission de gaz à effet de serre. En parallèle, le financement vert de l'institution passera de 24 % en 2020 à 40 % en 2026, et toutes ses opérations seront alignées sur les objectifs de l'Accord de Paris.

L'un des premiers projets dans le cadre de ce financement est l'accord pour la protection du Corridor marin du Pacifique tropical oriental (CMAR), une région partagée par la Colombie, le Costa Rica, l'Équateur et le Panama qui génère 3 milliards de dollars par an, principalement grâce à la pêche, au tourisme et au transport maritime. Grâce à une contribution de la CAF d'un million de dollars, des stratégies communes seront mises en œuvre avec la participation des gouvernements des quatre pays, de la société civile, des agences de coopération internationale et des ONG. La biodiversité du Corridor marin, qui comprend des zones coralliennes, le passage de grands migrateurs, des reptiles et de nombreux requins, est liée à l'offre culturelle et touristique des coutumes, de la gastronomie et de l'artisanat.

Situation des océans en Amérique latine et dans les Caraïbes

L'Amérique latine et les Caraïbes abritent l'une des zones marines productives les plus importantes du monde, avec une biodiversité unique qui représente une part importante de la biodiversité marine mondiale. C'est là que se trouve le Système de récifs de la barrière méso-américaine (MBRS), le deuxième plus grand récif barrière du monde. La région représente 18% des écorégions marines mondiales et compte 47 des 258 écorégions marines du monde.

Les effets du changement climatique sur les océans sont évidents : plus de 80 % des océans ont connu au moins une vague de chaleur marine en 2020 (45 % ont connu des vagues de chaleur fortes, tandis que 28 % ont connu des vagues de chaleur modérées), ce qui entraîne, entre autres, une réduction des stocks de poissons et la disparition des coraux. À cela s'ajoute la surexploitation des ressources marines côtières, notamment la pêche commerciale et illégale, le développement urbain non planifié dans les zones côtières et le déversement d'eaux usées non traitées dans la mer. Le CRFM estime qu'en 2019, la production de poisson dans les Caraïbes a diminué de 40 % par rapport à son niveau historiquement bas d'il y a dix ans. Pour sa part, la FAO a classé les stocks de poissons des Caraïbes parmi les plus appauvris au monde, avec 55 % des stocks de poissons commerciaux surexploités ou épuisés.

Les conséquences de la mauvaise santé des océans menacent la sécurité alimentaire mondiale, la durabilité de la planète et les systèmes de production et de commerce eux-mêmes. Il est donc impératif de promouvoir un nouveau consensus international pour construire des économies plus résilientes et diversifiées, générer de nouveaux emplois et préparer la région aux défis liés à la reprise économique dans un contexte de réchauffement climatique et d'affaiblissement des écosystèmes côtiers et marins.

Pour positionner la région en tant que leader dans la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique, la CAF donne la priorité à un agenda de durabilité qui valorise les initiatives présentant des co-bénéfices environnementaux et climatiques pour le développement de secteurs tels que l'eau, l'énergie, les infrastructures, les transports et la numérisation, entre autres. En outre, l'institution aide ses pays membres à stimuler l'économie bleue, à promouvoir la transition énergétique, à renforcer la conservation des écosystèmes naturels et de la biodiversité, et à atteindre une croissance à faible émission de gaz à effet de serre.

L'institution prévoit également de renforcer la mobilisation de sources de financement tierces, par exemple par l'émission d'obligations et de fonds verts et climatiques, et favorisera les alliances stratégiques afin d'améliorer le travail coordonné entre les gouvernements, la société civile, les organisations internationales, les ONG et le secteur privé. Cela permettra de préserver la biodiversité, de concevoir des politiques publiques d'adaptation et d'atténuation, de renforcer les capacités des gouvernements et d'encourager une croissance économique respectueuse de l'environnement et inclusive.",fr,"Lisbonne, Glasgow, le Costa Rica","la société civile, écorégions marines mondiales, la Colombie, les organisations internationales, CRFM, la pêche commerciale et illégale, les énergies marines renouvelables, le Panama, le Système de récifs de la barrière méso-américaine, CAF, Les conséquences de la mauvaise santé des océans menacent, FAO, écorégions marines du monde",Sergio Díaz-granados,"latine, caraïbes, climatique, océans, biodiversité, caf, dollars, marines, stocks, développement"

Canicule, sécheresse, incendies, orages et vents violents : l’été 2022 a été marqué par des catastrophes climatiques en cascade. « Beaucoup ont bien pris conscience de l’urgence climatique, on l’a vu encore plus cet été, affirme Marion Semblat, présidente de l’association à but non lucratif Time for the ocean qu’elle a créée en 2017 face au constat de plages trop polluées. L’une des réponses est de protéger l’océan qui se réchauffe et qui s’acidifie car c’est le régulateur de la machine climatique sur la planète ».

L’art et la science pour toucher

« Ce sont trois jours complets pour ceux qui souhaitent s’informer et agir ». Mené par l’association Time for the ocean, l’événement 24 Hours for the Ocean invite le public aux Franciscaines, à Deauville (Calvados), du vendredi 2 au dimanche 4 septembre 2022, à des grands rendez-vous associant les artistes et les scientifiques aux enjeux et dérives environnementaux face à l’urgence climatique. « On crée des passerelles, on est des courroies de transmission : on vient présenter des artistes qui touchent les gens et des scientifiques qui donnent des données concrètes, ce qui va déclencher une action ».

Ainsi, comme toujours, il s’agit d’abord de « mieux comprendre comment fonctionne cet énorme machine de régulation climatique » qu’est l’océan. Pour cela, les organisateurs travaillent à nouveau cette année avec les équipes de la fondation Tara Océan consacrée à l’océan en France qui développe une science ouverte, innovante et inédite devant permettre de prédire et de mieux anticiper l’impact du changement climatique.

« Il faut comprendre que cette grande machine climatique doit aussi être protégée dans son écosystème et dans sa biodiversité ». Ainsi, cette année, l’association organisatrice a également travaillé avec les équipes de la Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco. « Le Prince sera présent le dimanche 4 septembre 2022 à Deauville pour parler de sa fondation pour préserver les écosystèmes, la biodiversité de l’océan et l’environnement ». Durant ces deux-trois jours, seront également invités Cyril Dion, réalisateur du film Animal, Bianca Bondi, artiste sud-africaine, Laetitia Bisiaux, chercheuse à l’association Bloom, Fabrice Hyber, artiste, ou encore Edouard Carmignac, président de la Fondation Carmignac.

Sensibiliser les plus jeunes

Si à Deauville, l’accent est déjà mis sur la sensibilisation au développement durable, notamment à la cantine avec des produits sélectionnés issus des circuits courts, les jeunes seront encore une fois touchés par ces questions de protection de la planète lors de cette nouvelle édition de 24 Hours for the ocean.

Pour sensibiliser les plus jeunes, ces « adultes de demain qui vont nous aider à changer les choses », Time for the ocean convie l’artiste et le scientifique pour une journée qui leur est dédiée vendredi 2 septembre 2022. Des jeunes de la cité scolaire Maurois vont notamment pouvoir échanger en live avec la Goélette Tara qui est à Dakar. « Ça va être un moment très fort », sourit Marion Semblat. Comme pour le grand public le reste du week-end, un moment d’échange est prévu avec l’artiste Bianca Bondi à l’honneur du film documentaire Sea Art. « Quand on ressort de ces projections, on est toujours très touché, les artistes nous embarquent avec eux dans leur engagement », commente l’organisatrice.

Protection des écosystèmes marins, pêche durable, lutte contre les pollutions, notamment plastique... Le One Ocean Summit entend mobiliser la communauté internationale au cours de trois jours, du 09 au 11 février, en vue d’agir face aux innombrables menaces qui pèsent sur la santé de nos océans. Organisé en France, à Brest, avec le soutien des Nations unies, cet événement ambitieux se donne pour objectif de relever le « niveau d’ambition de la communauté internationale sur les sujets maritimes et de traduire en actions concrètes notre responsabilité partagée sur l’Océan ».Une, ateliers, forums, rencontres et initiatives se tiendront le 09 et 10 février. Le 11 février, le Président de la République Emmanuel Macron réunira un « nombre restreint mais déterminé » de chefs d’État et de gouvernement, de responsables d’institutions multilatérales, de chefs d’entreprises, et de décideurs de la société civile. L’enjeu est d’aboutir à des négociations multilatérales qui impactent l’océan et qui visent à nourrir la conférence des Nations unies Ocean qui se tiendra à Lisbonne, fin juin 2022.Le Comité français de l’UICN sera présent à Brest et appelle à la concrétisation de huit engagements « en réponse aux recommandations du Congrès mondial de la nature l’UICN portant sur l’océan ». Pour Maud Lelièvre, présidente du Comité français de l’UICN, « Le Congrès mondial de la nature à Marseille a lancé une nouvelle dynamique internationale pour la protection de la biodiversité. Le One Ocean Summit est une opportunité de la renforcer en faveur de l’océan avec des enjeux cruciaux puisqu’il représente 70% de la surface de notre planète. »Le Comité appelle ainsi la communauté internationale réunie lors de ce sommet à : achever les négociations de l’accord international sur la biodiversité marine des zones hors juridiction nationale (haute mer) le plus tôt possible ; à parvenir rapidement à un accord mondial pour combattre la pollution plastique ; à appliquer des démarches rigoureuses de planification des espaces maritimes ; à améliorer la gestion des dispositifs de concentration de poissons (DCP) ; renforcer les mesures de protection des espèces marines comme les requins et les raies qui sont menacées ; poursuivre la création d’aires marines protégées et soutenir collectivement l’objectif mondial de 30 % d’aires marines protégées à l’horizon 2030 et le respect de l’Accord de Paris en renforçant la conservation et la restauration des écosystèmes marins.« Reconnaissant les avancées dans les connaissances scientifiques depuis 2012 concernant l’exploitation minière des grands fonds marins, et les préoccupations exprimées par les scientifiques, pour qui la perte de la biodiversité sera inévitable si l’activité minière des grands fonds marins est autorisée... », le Comité invite par ailleurs les États à adopter unsur l’exploitation minière des fonds marins.",fr,"Marseille, Brest, Lisbonne, France","Le Comité appelle ainsi, Le Congrès mondial de la nature, Comité français de l’UICN, le soutien des Nations unies","Maud Lelièvre, Emmanuel Macron","marins, ocean, protection, comité, mondial, summit, communauté, internationale, l’océan, l’uicn"

Bernard Cauvin, président de la Cité de la Mer, était présent au premier Sommet sur les océans à Brest. Un « événement et une première majeure », selon lui. (©Jean Paul BARBIER / La Presse de la Manche)

« ONE OCEAN SUMMIT », c’est le nom donné au premier Sommet international sur les océans, organisé à Brest du 9 au 11 février dernier. De nombreux chefs d’État se sont ainsi rendus dans le Finistère pour mettre en place une coalition afin de protéger la biodiversité dans les eaux internationales.

La mission qui nous incombe de protéger les océans est nécessairement aussi vaste que la responsabilité que nous partageons. C'est la raison pour laquelle nous sommes venus aujourd'hui à Brest pour unir nos forces et inverser la tendance. L'Europe, en tant que puissance maritime, peut apporter une contribution considérable. Mais ce n'est qu'ensemble que nous pourrons protéger efficacement nos océans et leur permettre de regorger à nouveau de vie. Ursula von der LeyenPrésidente de la Commission européenne

« On ne prêche plus dans le vide »

Un message qui a fait chaud au cœur du Cherbourgeois Bernard Cauvin. Présent à ce sommet, le président de la Cité de la Mer a savouré l’instant. Le message qu’il prône depuis des décennies, notamment à travers la Cité de la Mer et des actions de sensibilisation de préservation des océans auprès des enfants, semble enfin avoir été entendu.

Ce sommet est une première, il mobilise plusieurs pays européens et même du monde. Certes, il en manque à l'appel, mais le symbole est fort. Même dans les rapports du GIEC et autres organismes de protection de l'environnement, l'océan et son rôle étaient peu abordés. Avec ce sommet, il devient un acteur majeur. Cela montre la volonté d'aller de l'avant, de lutter contre le pillage organisé des mers. C'est la clé de l'humanité ! Bernard CauvinPrésident de la Cité de la Mer

Le Cotentinois dit ressortir plus motivé que jamais après cette mobilisation européenne « très importante. Auparavant, l’Ifremer et les scientifiques prêchaient dans le vide, mais aujourd’hui, c’est fini ! ».

Bernard Cauvin savoure certaines mesures annoncées, comme celle de l’extension de la réserve naturelle nationale (RNN) des Terres australes françaises (TAF) sur l’ensemble des espaces maritimes des archipels Crozet et des îles Kerguelen, Saint-Paul et Amsterdam, administrés par les Terres australes et antarctiques françaises (TAAF).

Des initiatives prometteuses

Il se félicite également des trois initiatives engagées par Ursula von der Leyen : la nouvelle coalition internationale pour protéger la biodiversité en haute mer, qui représente 95 % des océans ; le projet informatique d’envergure permettant aux chercheurs d’accéder à des simulations numériques des océans de la planète ; et la mission de recherche de l’Union européenne visant à restaurer notre océan et notre milieu aquatique d’ici 2030.

« C’est la première fois qu’un diagnostic global est ainsi posé. C’est le début… », affirme le président de la Cité de la Mer, qui se dit persuadé que c’est en faisant aimer la mer que les peuples la protégeront. « On protège ce qu’on aime ! », clame-t-il.

Les défenseurs des océans espèrent que cet événement, à l'initiative d'Emmanuel Macron, leur offre un coup de pouce politique pour faire enfin aboutir un traité destiné à protéger la haute mer, trésor fragilisé par les activités humaines.

Et ce sommet est aussi l'occasion pour certains candidats à l'élection présidentielle de rappeler leurs propositions pour la protection des océans et leur biodiversité. On fait le point sur toutes les mesures prônées par les prétendants à l’Élysée.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon veut développer les énergies marines renouvelables

Lors de son meeting « immersif et olfactif » de janvier dernier, Jean-Luc Mélenchon a voulu se projeter vers « les nouvelles frontières de l'humanité », à savoir l'espace, le numérique et… la mer ! Le chef de file des Insoumis a prôné « le mouvement des marées et les courants » pour sortir du nucléaire. Dans son programme, il propose en ce sens de développer les énergies marines renouvelables, estimant que « la France est une puissance maritime qui s’ignore » et que « la mer est une source formidable d’activités pour la bifurcation écologique ». Il propose de nationaliser la branche énergies marine d'Alstom et de la branche éolienne d'Areva.

Le candidat LFI veut en outre créer un « droit international de la biodiversité marine », plaide pour la mise en place d'un moratoire sur l'exploitation minière en eaux profondes, et entend éradiquer les techniques de pêche dangereuses, comme la pêche électrique. « Il est urgent de protéger les mers et les océans de la surpêche, de la pollution plastique et des tensions militaires », est-il écrit dans son programme « L'Avenir en commun ».

Fabien Roussel prône « une politique de protection du domaine maritime »

Dans son programme, le candidat communiste propose « une politique de protection du domaine maritime ». Elle serait conduite « sous l’égide d’un grand ministère de la Mer », avec plusieurs objectifs : développer l'utilisation des algues pour remplacer notamment le plastique, favoriser une « algoculture écologique » et développer un « tourisme bleu respectueux de la nature ». Côté biodiversité, Fabien Roussel souhaite porter la part des espaces protégés terrestres et maritimes à 30%, contre respectivement 20% et 23% aujourd'hui.

Yannick Jadot dit « stop à l'exploitation des fonds marins »

Le candidat écologiste veut interdire l'exploration minière des fonds marins, dans toute la zone économique exclusive française (soit plus de 11 millions de km²). « Exploiter les fonds marins laissera non seulement des traces irréversibles sur la biodiversité, mais dégagera également de grandes quantités de carbone stockées dans les océans », martèle-t-il dans une tribune au JDD publiée à la veille de l'ouverture du One Ocean Summit.

Dans son programme, il propose par ailleurs de sanctuariser « 30% de nos aires maritimes ». « 10% seront sous protection intégrale sur chaque territoire, façade maritime et bassin ultramarin », ajoute-t-il. Il prévoit aussi de défendre « 30% des aires marines protégées à l’échelle mondiale, notamment en Antarctique ».

Anne Hidalgo mise sur la recherche pour faire face à la montée des eaux

La candidate PS prévoit d'investir dans le développement de solutions technologiques et écologiques pour faire face à la montée des eaux. Cet investissement sera financé par un prélèvement « 1% océans » sur les budgets publicitaires des entreprises pour la prévention des déchets dans les espaces maritimes, est-il écrit dans son programme. Elle veut également renforcer l'arsenal juridique contre le dépôt de déchets sauvages.

Plus largement, la socialiste propose de créer un « ministère du climat, de la biodiversité et de l'économie », et inscrire dans la Constitution « la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique et la perte de biodiversité ».

Valérie Pécresse fixe un « objectif zéro plastique »

Dans son programme, la championne de LR veut pour sa part faire en sorte que 10% du territoire maritime national soit « sous protection forte d'ici 20 ans ». Elle fixe un « objectif zéro plastique » avec la signature d'un accord des pays riverains de la Méditerranée pour « l'éradication des rejets de plastiques en mer ».

Sur la question des éoliennes, la candidate indique que, si elle est élue, des zones d'interdiction d'implantation pourront être prévues dans les plans locaux d'urbanisme. « Les intérêts des pêcheurs seront protégés », ajoute-t-elle.",fr,"Brest, la France","LFI, les énergies marines renouvelables

Au départ, un formulaire

Un formulaire reçu à la mairie a retenu l’attention de Catherine Dupart, adjointe à l’urbanisme. Il énumérait les critères pris en compte pour l’obtention du label « protection des océans » : installation de cendriers dans les espaces publics, de fontaines à eau pour remplir les gourdes, limitation du plastique à usage unique, véhicules électriques, arrêts anti-pesticides, pistes cyclables, cantines approvisionnées en bio local, etc. Dix critères qui recensent les actions mises en place en 2022 et les prévisions pour 2025. Il fallait en cocher au moins cinq, Catherine Dupart n’a eu aucun mal à en cocher huit, et d’autres actions sont programmées pour les années à venir.

La réponse, positive, est arrivée à la mairie. La Brède est la 2e commune de gironde (après Lacanau, et la 9e en France) à obtenir le label « protection des océans » dont le but est « de sensibiliser les communes et leurs administrés ; il ne s’agit pas d’une médaille d’exemplarité, mais d’affirmer que l’on sait et qu’en agissant, on refuse la fatalité de la pollution des océans ».",fr,France,La Brède,Catherine Dupart,"protection, brède, commune, pollution, un, mairie, catherine, dupart, label, actions"

185,2022-06-08,Claire Nouvian : « La protection des océans est une affaire 100 % politique »,https://www.lavie.fr/actualite/ecologie/claire-nouvian-la-protection-des-oceans-est-une-affaire-100-politique-82730.php,4,2,2,0,lavie.fr,France,"Instaurée en 1992, lors du sommet de la Terre de Rio, la Journée mondiale des océans vise à sensibiliser la population mondiale sur le rôle vital de ces espaces marins, dans la sauvegarde de la vie sur Terre.

De manière quotidienne, des associations, comme Bloom, association française de lutte contre la destruction de l’océan et des pêcheurs, militent auprès des pouvoirs publics, entre autres, afin que ces derniers s'engagent dans la protection de l’océan. Essentiel à notre survie, la France à un rôle important à jouer pour protéger le « poumon bleu ». C’est une des raisons qui a motivé Bloom à éditer une « charte océan » en vue des élections législatives.

Pourquoi avoir créé la « charte océan » en vue des élections législatives ?

Pour nous, c’est un moyen d’alerter et d’engager nos élus sur la problématique des océans. Ce sujet est totalement invisibilisé dans les médias et les cercles politiques. Alors que les océans couvrent plus de 70 % de la planète et qu’ils sont un de nos plus grands biens communs à toutes et tous. Les activités humaines sont en train de le dévaster dans un silence assez assourdissant. Par cette charte, nous souhaitons que les candidats, une fois élus, s’engagent à légiférer pour protéger les océans.

Il est urgent de tout repenser. Nous l’affirmons dans nos dix revendications inscrites dans la charte. Il faut aider la pêche industrielle à effectuer sa transition et favoriser la pêche artisanale, qui génère plus d’emplois et qui demande moins d’argent public, le tout en protégeant la biodiversité marine. Surtout, il faut que l’ensemble des décisions concernant l’océan soient transparentes et publiques.

Nous avons déjà trop perdu de temps, d’argent, mis en danger notre sécurité alimentaire, détruit les écosystèmes marins et les populations de poissons (selon les Nations unies, 90 % de la population des gros poissons sont déjà épuisés et 50 % des barrières de corail sont détruites, ndlr).

Pourquoi s’aventurer ainsi dans le champ politique ?

Bloom est apolitique, mais notre combat est éminemment politique. L’océan est un bien commun. Son intégralité est contrôlée par les pouvoirs publics, donc sa protection est une affaire 100 % politique. Ce n’est pas la première fois que nous agissons auprès des candidats lors d’élections. Certains nous contactent pour les aider à concevoir leur programme. Parfois, c’est nous qui les sollicitons. En 2017, nous avions communiqué nos propositions au candidat Emmanuel Macron. Mais aucune n’a été reprise dans le programme d’En Marche.

Notre combat a plus d’écho chez certains élus de gauche, sensibilisés à la protection de l’océan et de l’environnement. À l’heure actuelle, les candidats de La France insoumise ou d’EELV ont massivement signé notre charte. Mathilde Panot, Manuel Bompard, Julien Bayou ou encore Clémence Guetté se sont engagés à respecter nos revendications s’ils sont élus. Les élus du Parti communiste et du PS se font plus timides.

Pourquoi est-il primordial que la France agisse pour la protection des océans ?

La France est la deuxième puissance maritime mondiale, juste après les États-Unis. Nous avons la plus grande superficie de fonds marins au sein des zones économiques exclusives (ZEE). La France doit protéger ces zones maritimes, sauvegarder leur biodiversité, pour le bien-être de la planète, du climat, des citoyens. L’océan régule la production d’oxygène, l’absorption de CO 2 , le stockage du carbone et les excédents de chaleur. Nous ne pouvons pas faire sans un océan en bonne santé.

À l’heure actuelle, la politique d’Emmanuel Macron est anti-environnementale. Il a dépassé le stade de l’inaction, car dans les faits, il agit contre le climat. Ses actes et les politiques qu’il entreprend sont à l’inverse de ce qu’il faut pour sauver la planète et l’humanité.

En 2021, Emmanuel Macron affirmait avoir pour objectif de protéger 30 % des espaces maritimes et terrestres, dont 10 % placés sous « protection forte ». Aujourd’hui, nous avons déposé un recours contre le décret 2022-527 du 12 avril dernier, qui définit la mise en œuvre de ces espaces particuliers, car dans ce texte, la définition des aires marines sous « protection totale» ou « forte» ne respecte pas les standards internationaux. Selon l’Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature (UICN), toutes activités industrielles sont interdites dans les aires marines protégées. Et au sein des zones dites de « protection forte », même les activités humaines à faible impact, comme la pêche artisanale, sont interdites. Or, avec ce décret, Emmanuel Macron anéantit le concept même d’aire marine protégée en autorisant l’exploitation industrielle (pêche ou extraction de minerais). C’est scandaleux !

Selon le recensement réalisé par l’Atlas des aires marines protégées (MPA Atlas), les États-Unis ont 24 % de leur ZEE sous « protection forte », voire « intégrale ». Au Royaume-Uni, ce sont 39 % de ces espaces maritimes qui sont placés sous protection forte ou intégrale. En France, on est à moins de 4 % de zones marines réellement protégées. Nous sommes lamentablement en retard !

En voyant le décret du gouvernement, on a compris qu’Emmanuel Macron n’avait aucune volonté d’être honnête ou sérieux sur les sujets écologiques. Les promesses faites ont encore été instrumentalisées à des fins électorales. Ces mensonges constants sont destructeurs pour la démocratie. Le cynisme politique a une fois de plus rattrapé la réalité. La droite n’est pas écologiste, mais elle ne ment pas. Ses électeurs savent qu’ils ne votent pas pour le climat ou la biodiversité, il n’y a pas de tromperie. C’est ce régime du mensonge écologique par défaut qui provoque un tel rejet du parti d’Emmanuel Macron.",fr,France,"Royaume-Uni, La France, MPA Atlas, la pêche artisanale, la biodiversité marine, les États-Unis, association française de lutte, l’Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature, selon les Nations unies, UICN, l’Atlas des aires marines protégées, Parti communiste, la Journée mondiale des océans, PS","Clémence Guetté, Manuel Bompard, Claire Nouvian, Mathilde Panot, Julien Bayou, Emmanuel Macron","protection, océans, politique, france, macron, charte, forte, l’océan, pêche, la"

Des dessins qui attirent le jeune public : « Ma petite-fille Salomé a été captivée, surtout en voyant les autres enfants », s’amuse Dominique, tandis que Salomé fait tourner une roue où sont représentés des animaux, des déchets ou encore une réserve naturelle. « Sur le jeu de la roue, chaque enfant doit choisir un animal puis tourner la roue.

188,2022-08-03,Le Gabon propose un plan pour la protection des océans,https://www.afrique-centrale.fr/2022/08/03/le-gabon-propose-un-plan-pour-la-protection-des-oceans/,1,1,0,0,afrique-centrale.fr,France,"Le réseau gabonais d’aires marines protégées (AMP) fournit un modèle qui pourrait être utilisé dans de nombreux autres pays, selon les experts. Depuis l’annonce d’un nouveau réseau d’AMP en 2014, le Gabon a créé 20 aires protégées, augmentant ainsi la protection des eaux gabonaises de moins de 1 % à 26 %.

Le nouveau document – rédigé par des décideurs politiques gabonais, des ONG et des chercheurs de l’Université d’Exeter – met en évidence les leçons de ce travail et sa pertinence ailleurs.

“Une combinaison de facteurs a rendu ce réseau d’AMP possible, mais une première étape cruciale a été la création par le président Ali Bongo Ondimba d’une initiative gouvernementale appelée” Gabon Bleu “en 2013“, a déclaré le Dr Kristian Metcalfe, du Centre d’écologie et de Conservation au campus Penryn d’Exeter à Cornwall.

« Cela a envoyé un signal clair que le gouvernement gabonais souhaitait développer un réseau d’AMP ».

« Cela a garanti que tous les secteurs – des agences gouvernementales aux utilisateurs des ressources océaniques – étaient impliqués dans le processus de planification, et cela a donné confiance aux bailleurs de fonds externes et au secteur privé pour soutenir la recherche qui sous-tend les AMP »

Le Dr Emma Stokes, directrice régionale de la Wildlife Conservation Society pour l’Afrique centrale et le golfe de Guinée, a ajouté : « Cette volonté politique et cet engagement à long terme étaient essentiels, créant un « point de basculement » vers un changement efficace.

“L’action collective a accéléré les progrès et le pays s’est désormais engagé à respecter l’engagement 30×30 de protéger 30% de ses océans d’ici 2030.”

La couverture mondiale des AMP est encore en deçà de l’objectif de 10 % fixé en 2010, en partie en raison de progrès limités dans de nombreux pays à revenu faible et intermédiaire.

Cependant, quelques-uns de ces pays – dont le Gabon – ont respecté ou dépassé les engagements internationaux sur terre et sur mer.

Le nouveau document soutient que les leçons du Gabon peuvent être utilisées pour éclairer les engagements et la mise en œuvre de la biodiversité mondiale post-2020.

Une approche en 4 étapes

Les gouvernements doivent renforcer et maintenir leur capacité de recherche et de mise en œuvre, en veillant à ce que les preuves scientifiques sous-tendent les décisions politiques.

Les pays devraient faire des promesses publiques sur les objectifs de conservation marine, signalant leur engagement envers la communauté internationale et les donateurs potentiels.

La communauté de la conservation devrait réagir en aidant à créer ou à renforcer les agences environnementales du pays, soit directement, soit, si les garanties financières sont faibles, via des organisations internationales.

Chaque agence de mise en œuvre devrait diriger l’élaboration de cadres nationaux de conservation marine, en travaillant avec les parties prenantes et les donateurs pour produire des plans ambitieux mais politiquement réalisables, combinant autant que possible des initiatives descendantes avec des approches ascendantes.

Au Gabon, un travail crucial de mise en œuvre a été mené par l’agence des parcs nationaux, l’ANPN.

Le professeur Lee White, ministre gabonais des forêts, des océans, de l’environnement et du changement climatique et ancien secrétaire exécutif (chef) de l’ANPN, a déclaré : « Nous avons appris du processus qui a abouti à la création des parcs nationaux terrestres du Gabon par Omar Bongo en 2007 et nous avons capable de fournir le cadre scientifique et juridique pour faire de la vision du président Ali Bongo Ondimba d’une économie bleue durable une réalité.”

Le professeur Brendan Godley, de l’Université d’Exeter, a ajouté : « En étendant les mesures de conservation et de gestion des pêches à l’ensemble de sa ZEE, le Gabon a pris des mesures importantes pour assurer la persistance à long terme de sa biodiversité marine et de ses ressources halieutiques, et devrait être célébré comme un exemple mondial.”

A cette occasion, Surfrider Foundation Europe et le Blue Collective de Bordeaux mettent en place un évènement destiné aux entrepreneurs, cadres dirigeants et investisseurs. Ils seront une centaine à se rendre à Lacanau (33), de 16h à 22h. L’objectif : sensibiliser ce public, directement sur le terrain, à la pollution et aux enjeux de la préservation de l’océan. Un appel aux dons est lancé afin de contribuer à la levée de fonds Blue Horizon.

La levée de fonds Blue Horizon a pour objectif de lever un million d’euros en deux ans, grâce aux grands donateurs, afin de financer 10 grands projets d’associations. Avec le co-financement du programme européen, Blue Horizon devrait lever 3 millions d’euros. « Pour atteindre cette somme avec les grands donateurs, un collectif d’une centaine de personnalités a été créé : des experts dans la French tech, et des fonds d’investissement, des athlètes, des acteurs, des artistes… Ce collectif nous aide à aller chercher de grands donateurs, via un réseau que nous n’avons pas naturellement chez Surfrider, » décrit Marine Piers, coordinatrice de la campagne de levée de fonds Blue Horizon. Le collectif créé dans ce cadre, Blue Collective, se divise en antennes locales.

Aujourd’hui, à Lacanau, les entrepreneurs et cadres dirigeants participeront à une collecte de déchets suivie de leur quantification. Ils assisteront ensuite à une explication des enjeux pour la préservation de l’océan. Enfin, lors d’un cocktail, des bénévoles seront présents pour répondre aux questions. L’occasion aussi de lancer un appel aux dons, « pour que Surfrider puisse continuer à sensibiliser et agir, » souligne Marine Piers. « Pour nous, la journée mondiale de l’océan c’est tous les jours. » poursuit-elle. Le principal objectif et la raison d’être de l’association sont la préservation et la protection de l’océan, en particulier via 3 grandes thématiques : les déchets aquatiques, la pollution invisible (chimique et bactériologique), et l’aménagement du littoral et le changement climatique. Cette soirée permettra notamment à Surfrider de collecter des données, grâce à la quantification de déchets ramassés, afin d’agir auprès des pouvoirs publics.

LISBONNE (Reuters) - Le secrétaire général de l'Onu, Antonio Guterres, a déclaré lundi que l'""égoïsme"" de certaines nations entravait les efforts visant à conclure un traité très attendu pour protéger les océans du monde.

Interrogé par les journalistes lors de la Conférence des Nations unies sur les océans à Lisbonne quant aux obstacles à la conclusion d'un accord, il a répondu : ""L'égoïsme"".

""Certaines personnes pensent encore qu'elles sont assez puissantes pour penser que les eaux internationales devraient leur appartenir"", a-t-il ajouté.

Antonio Guterres a également appelé les gouvernements et les entreprises à engager davantage de fonds pour contribuer à la création d'un modèle économique durable pour la gestion de l'environnement marin.

""Malheureusement, nous avons considéré l'océan comme acquis, et aujourd'hui nous sommes confrontés à ce que j'appellerais une 'urgence océanique'"", a-t-il déclaré. ""Nous devons inverser le cours des choses"".

Il est nécessaire de mettre en place des modèles commerciaux qui pourraient aider l'océan à produire plus de nourriture et à générer plus d'énergie renouvelable, a affirmé le secrétaire général.

""Cela implique de nouveaux niveaux de financement à long terme"", a-t-il ajouté.

""Les dirigeants réunis à Lisbonne vont se féliciter mutuellement de leurs bons résultats en matière de protection marine, alors que la crise des océans s'aggrave"", a déclaré Laura Meller, de Greenpeace. ""Nous n'avons pas besoin d'un autre salon de discussion, avec de vagues déclarations"".

194,2022-03-18,France at the forefront of ocean protection,https://lafrench-fab.com/news/france-at-the-forefront-of-ocean-protection/,2,0,2,0,lafrench-fab.com,France,"The oceans cover more than 70% of the surface of our planet.

France has adopted a series of measures to protect its sea fauna and flora. Businesses are innovating to reduce human impact on the ocean.

Small-scale fishers represent 50% of worldwide fishing in quantity every year. While industrial fishing boats are tracked and monitored, the two million small, under-12-meter boats that crisscross the world’s seas and oceans are not. To fill this gap, French company CLS – which is based in Nantes – developed the Nemo transceiver. Targeted specifically at the small-scale fishing sector, the transceiver uses mini-satellite data to monitor the activity of boats. Several countries, including the United Kingdom and Gabon, have adopted the system and require their fishers to purchase a Nemo transceiver to make sure they don’t stray into protected areas. The authorities can therefore model the health of the marine environment, take measures to prevent overfishing, and sustainably manage fish resources. The Nemo transceiver is self-powered by a solar panel, which facilitates its adoption in poorly developed areas with no electricity supply. It also has an emergency button that can be used to call for assistance in the event of a problem.

CLS is a perfect illustration of how La French Fab is innovating to develop ocean protection. Underwater ecosystems are not only endangered by overfishing, but also by pollution, oil & gas exploitation, and global warming which is causing ocean acidification. Last year, in response to these worrying trends, the United Nations Organization introduced a Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030). France aims to play a leading role in ocean conservation. In February it hosted the One Ocean Summit in Brittany, the first ever global summit on the issue. The stakes are high: oceans absorb 90% of the heat generated by greenhouse gases. Without their regulating effect, humanity would not survive.

France has a key role to play. With its 10.2 million square kilometers of marine area, it has the second biggest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world. It has turned 30% of it into protected marine areas, the most well-known being the Coral Sea and the French Southern and Antarctic Lands. The government has also introduced fish conservation areas, anti-collision systems on French boats to protect cetaceans, as well as measures to protect mangroves and coral reefs in French overseas territories. The French Fab community is contributing to the national effort. French firms in the nautical, fishing, maritime transport, energy, cosmetics, and material production industries have adopted the Ocean Benchmark developed by the Sea Foundation. Thanks to this tool, which is based on UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water), businesses can measure and improve the impact of their interactions with the ocean. A collective effort is required. La French Fab is firmly committed to doing its bit.",en,"the United Kingdom, Gabon, France, Brittany, Nantes","CLS, La French Fab, the United Nations Organization, UN, the Sea Foundation",,"ocean, french, france, fishing, boats, transceiver, areas, oceans, measures, sea"

Vers 9 heures ce matin, les pirogues doubles traditionnelles Hōkūle’a, Hikianalia et Fa’afaite, ont franchi la passe Te Ava Mo’a, jadis empruntée par les grands navigateurs polynésiens. L’entrée s’est faite dans la tradition et les rites culturels anciens, au son des puet des levées de pales de rame.

Guidés par les anciens jusqu’au mouillage de To’a Hiva, les navigateurs se sont rendus près du rivage pour le rituel du Taura’a-Tapu, lequel permet aux équipages de fouler la terre sacrée de Taputapuātea.Le Tapu étant désormais levé, les équipages ont rejoint les participants du Blue Climate Summit et la communauté de Taputapuātea pour la grande cérémonie de salutations et de bénédictions Fa’atau – arōha sur le grand Marae de Taputapuātea.

Pour les navigateurs hawaiiens de la Polynesian Voyaging Society, ce retour aux sources originelles est à chaque fois un moment fort, empreint d’émotions. Il est la preuve de ce lien éternel tissé à travers le temps, entre les peuples du Pacifique, issus du grand océan “Te Moana Nui O Hiva”.

Des orero, chants et danses, au son des pahu et des pu, ont rythmé ce moment exceptionnel. Une cérémonie haute en couleurs et chargée d’émotions rendue possible grâce aux efforts conjoints du Pays, de la Teti’aroa Society, des associations culturelles et environnementales et de la commune de Taputapuātea.

202,2022-02-10,Protection des océans : Le Gabon vu en leader par l’Université d'Exeter | Gabonreview.com | Actualité du Gabon,https://www.gabonreview.com/protection-des-oceans-le-gabon-vu-en-leader-par-luniversite-dexeter/,17,16,1,0,gabonreview.com,Gabon,"Sur la base d’un document rédigé par des décideurs politiques gabonais, des ONG et des chercheurs de l’Université d’Exeter, en Angleterre, mettant en évidence un plan pour la protection des océans et sa gestion du réseau d’aires marines protégées (AMP), le Gabon est perçu comme un leader mondial en matière de protection des océans.

Dans le cadre de l’évaluation des progrès accomplis par les Etats au cours de la dernière décennie dans la lutte contre les facteurs sous-jacents qui influencent les pressions directes sur la biodiversité et dans la formulation de nouvelles politiques et stratégies pour la décennie à venir, le Gabon à travers la conservation marine, demeure l’un des rares pays à avoir respecté et dépassé les engagements internationaux relatifs à la couverture mondiale des aires marines protégées (AMP) de 10 % fixé en 2010.

En effet, depuis l’annonce d’un nouveau réseau d’AMP en 2014, le Gabon a créé 20 aires protégées, augmentant ainsi la protection de ses eaux de moins de 1 % à 26 %. Un modèle salué par les chercheurs de l’Université d’Exeter, qui estiment à travers un document rédigé en collaboration avec des décideurs politiques gabonais et des ONG, que les « leçons de ce travail et sa pertinence ailleurs », peuvent être utilisées dans de nombreux autres pays pour éclairer les engagements et la mise en œuvre de la biodiversité mondiale post-2020.

«Nous avons appris du processus qui a abouti à la création des parcs nationaux terrestres du Gabon par Omar Bongo en 2007 et avons été capable de fournir le cadre scientifique et juridique pour faire de la vision du président Ali Bongo Ondimba, d’une économie bleue durable, une réalité », a déclaré le ministre en charge de l’Environnement, Lee White, relayé par nos confrères du media en ligne euronews.com

Selon le Pr Brendan Godley, de l’Université d’Exeter, « en étendant les mesures de conservation et de gestion des pêches à l’ensemble de sa ZEE, le Gabon a pris des mesures importantes pour assurer la persistance à long terme de sa biodiversité marine et de ses ressources halieutiques, et devrait être célébré comme un exemple mondial»

Publiées dans la revue «Conservation Letters» et intitulé : «Fulfilling global marine engagements; les leçons apprises du Gabon », ces réussites du Gabon proposent une approche en quatre étapes pour les pays et les donateurs : premièrement, les États doivent renforcer et maintenir leur capacité de recherche et de mise en œuvre, en veillant à ce que les preuves scientifiques sous-tendent les décisions politiques. Deuxièmement, les pays devraient s’engager publiquement à adopter des objectifs mondiaux de conservation marine, signalant leur engagement envers la communauté internationale et les donateurs potentiels.

Troisièmement, la communauté de la conservation devrait réagir en aidant à créer ou à renforcer les agences environnementales du pays, soit directement, soit, si les garanties financières sont faibles, via des organisations internationales. Quatrièmement, chaque agence de mise en œuvre devrait diriger l’élaboration de cadres nationaux de conservation marine, en travaillant avec les parties prenantes et les donateurs pour produire des plans ambitieux mais politiquement réalisables, combinant autant que possible des initiatives descendantes avec des approches ascendantes.

Ces quatre étapes dépendent d’un financement à long terme pour maintenir l’élan, la capacité et la sensibilisation, mais le Gabon montre que le financement à court terme peut également être efficace, seulement s’il fait partie d’un programme plus large et coordonné basé sur des fondations solides. Cependant, le plus grand défi auquel sont confrontés de nombreux pays, y compris le Gabon, est d’obtenir des financements pour établir et gérer des AMP, dont il a été démontré qu’ils évoluent avec la couverture et qu’ils sont plus élevés pour les AMP à usage multiple.",fr,"le Gabon, Angleterre, Le Gabon, Gabon","Actualité du Gabon, les Etats au cours de la dernière décennie, ZEE, AMP, ONG, l’Université d'Exeter |","Ali Ondimba, Lee White, Omar Bongo, Le Godley","gabon, conservation, pays, marine, protection, l’université, océans, d’exeter, biodiversité, engagements"

Eleven projects are currently in their final phase, and one has already been concluded. Four new projects are to be launched in the summer of 2022. 32 institutions in all are taking part in the initiative: in Germany, these include the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, the Alfred Wegener Institute and Kiel University, while the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), the University of Namibia and the Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI) are among those participating in Africa. One of the central guiding principles of MeerWissen is to establish partnerships on an equal footing. As Stöbener explains, African institutions were given access to the technologies, innovations and networks of German marine research. The latter profits in turn from the expertise of its African partners, which allows it to gear its work to national and regional agendas and requirements.

More knowledge about eels

The Bremerhaven-based Thünen Institute for example is regarded as one of the world’s leading centres of research into freshwater eels. In the MeerWissen project BIOEELS-TZ, the researchers draw on their knowledge of eels in temperate zones to research tropical species. Tanzania is home to more than 40 eel-like fishes; some of these snake-like bony fishes are endangered. To protect them, the biodiversity of migrating eels in coastal rivers is being studied, among other things.

The university in Dar es Salaam and the TAFIRI are responsible for the socioeconomic part of the project, as BIOEELS-TZ combines biology and the social sciences. Part of the research involves interviewing fishermen, for instance. Because eels react sensitively to environmental changes and Tanzania’s population is set to see considerable growth, it is important to preserve the eels, protect their natural habitats and ensure sustainable fishing.

Mouhamed Moustapha Fall and Kwabena Owusu from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) in Senegal and Agostino Merico from the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research (ZMT) in Bremen are convinced that their project INDUCE can have a political impact. Though the coasts of Senegal are characterised by great biodiversity, these areas are also important for the country’s economy. “The project INDUCE seeks to produce sound scientific knowledge for the conservation of fish functional diversity from socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth perspectives in Senegal”, says Owusu . The ZMT and the AIMS have already been working together for almost ten years, and the Oceanographic Research Center of Dakar-Thiaroye (CRODT) is now also involved in INDUCE. Together they are studying the diversity of fish species in Senegal.",en,"Bremen, Tanzania, Germany, Senegal, Bremerhaven, Dar es Salaam","the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Kiel University, the University of Namibia, BIOEELS-TZ, CRODT, SANBI, Thünen Institute, AIMS, TAFIRI, the South African National Biodiversity Institute, the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research, ZMT, MeerWissen, the Oceanographic Research Center of Dakar-Thiaroye, the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, the Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute, INDUCE, the Alfred Wegener Institute","Agostino Merico, Kwabena Owusu, Mouhamed Fall","research, eels, african, institute, project, senegal, marine, meerwissen, projects, university"

Nach Kremlangaben sprach Putin am Donnerstag bei einem Telefonat mit dem türkischen Präsidenten Recep Tayyip Erdogan von einer „beispiellosen Sabotage“ gegen die Gasleitungen von Russland nach Deutschland. Russland habe dazu für diesen Freitag eine Dringlichkeitsdebatte im UN-Sicherheitsrat beantragt, sagte Putin demnach.

Die russische Generalstaatsanwaltschaft hatte wegen der mutmaßlichen Sabotage an den Pipelines am Mittwoch ein Verfahren wegen internationalen Terrorismus eingeleitet. Auch Kremlsprecher Dmitri Peskow sprach bereits von einem „Terrorakt“ - Putin selbst hatte sich bislang aber noch nicht so klar geäußert.

Europäische Sicherheitsbeamte hatten am Montag und Dienstag zwei russische Marineschiffe in der Nähe der Lecks an den Nord-Stream-Gasleitungen in der Ostsee gesichtet. Das berichtet der amerikanische Sender „CNN“ unter Berufung auf westliche Geheimdienstmitarbeiter. Auch russische U-Boote sollen in der vergangenen Woche in dem Gebet unterwegs gewesen sein.

Unklar blieb dabei zunächst, ob die Schiffe in Verbindung mit den Explosionen an den Pipelines zu Beginn der Woche stehen. CNN zitiert einen Beamten des dänischen Militärs, der die Anwesenheit russischer Schiffe in diesem Gebiet als Routine bezeichnet.

An den russischen Nord-Stream-Pipelines waren Anfang der Woche innerhalb kurzer Zeit in dänischen und schwedischen Gewässern zunächst drei Lecks entdeckt worden. Die genaue Ursache ist zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt nicht bekannt. Westliche Sicherheitsexperten gehen aber von Sabotage aus.

Deutsche Behörden gehen von Sprengsatz-Einsatz aus

Deutsche Sicherheitsbehörden gehen laut einem Bericht des „Spiegel“ davon aus, dass bei der Beschädigung der Nord-Stream-Gaspipelines in der Ostsee hochwirksame Sprengsätze zum Einsatz kamen. Berechnungen hätten ergeben, dass für die Zerstörung der Röhren Sprengsätze eingesetzt worden sein müssen, deren Wirkung mit der von 500 Kilo TNT vergleichbar ist, berichtete der „Spiegel“ am Donnerstag.

In die Schätzung seien auch die von diversen Messstationen registrierten seismischen Signale einbezogen worden, hieß es in dem Bericht weiter. Der Nato-Rat, die EU und Vertreter unter anderem der Regierungen Schwedens, Dänemarks und Polens gehen von einer vorsätzlichen Tat als wahrscheinlichstem Grund für die Lecks aus. Die Bundesregierung hält sich mit solchen Äußerungen bislang zurück.

Weitere Informationen erhofft sich die Bundesregierung laut „Spiegel“ von einer genaueren Untersuchung der Pipelines Nord Stream 1 und 2. In Sicherheitskreisen hieß es, dass Taucher oder ein ferngesteuerter Roboter möglicherweise schon am Wochenende die Schäden begutachten könnten. Dann könnten im besten Fall erste Rückschlüsse auf die Art der Explosion unter Wasser und den dabei eingesetzten Sprengstoff gezogen werden.

Schweden meldet viertes Leck

Schwedens Küstenwache hatte zuletzt ein viertes Gasleck an den beschädigten Nord-Stream-Pipelines in der Ostsee entdeckt. Das Loch sei ebenfalls diese Woche gefunden worden, zitierte die Zeitung „Svenska Dagbladet“ am Donnerstag einen Sprecher der Küstenwache.

„Es gibt zwei Lecks auf schwedischem Gebiet und zwei auf dänischem“, erklärte ein Verantwortlicher der schwedischen Küstenwache zudem gegenüber der Nachrichtenagentur AFP - die beiden Lecks auf schwedischem Gebiet lägen „nahe beieinander“.

Drei der vier Lecks an den Nord-Stream-Gasleitungen in der Ostsee befinden sich in wenigen Kilometern Abstand zueinander. Die beiden Austrittspunkte in der Ausschließlichen Wirtschaftszone Schwedens liegen nur eine Seemeile voneinander entfernt, was knapp 1,8 Kilometern entspricht, wie die schwedische Küstenwache am Donnerstag mitteilte. Der kleinere davon und einer der beiden in der dänischen Zone hätten einen Abstand von 2,6 Seemeilen (rund 4,6 Kilometern) zueinander.

Einem russischen Medienbericht zufolge könnte ein US-Hubschrauber an den Lecks in den beiden Gas-Pipelines Nord Stream 1 und 2 beteiligt sein.

„Der Mehrzweck-Helikopter MH-60R Strike Hawk hat neun Stunden lang - von 19:30 Moskauer Zeit am Sonntag dem 25. September bis 4:30 Uhr Moskauer Zeit am Montag dem 26. September über der Ostsee gekreist; etwa 250 Kilometer von der dänischen Insel Bornholm entfernt, wo der Gasaustritt festgestellt wurde“, schrieb die Internetzeitung lenta.ru am Mittwoch unter Berufung auf Daten von Flightradar. Der Kampfhubschrauber könne unter anderem auch Unterwasserziele bekämpfen, betonte das als kremlnah geltende Medium.

In der Nacht zum Montag hatten die Betreiber Lecks in den beiden Gasleitungen festgestellt. Die EU und die Nato gehen von Sabotage aus. Der Kreml hatte am Mittwoch Spekulationen über eine russische Beteiligung an der Beschädigung der Pipelines als „dumm und absurd“ zurückgewiesen. Moskau sieht sich selbst als Geschädigten, die Behörden haben ein Terrorismusverfahren eingeleitet und Moskau hat eine Sitzung des UN-Sicherheitsrats zu der Frage gefordert.

Deutsche Sicherheitsbehörden gehen unterdessen davon aus, dass die drei Röhren der Ostseepipeline Nord Stream 1 und 2 nach mutmaßlichen Sabotageakten für immer unbrauchbar sein werden. Wenn sie nicht schnell repariert würden, werde sehr viel Salzwasser einlaufen und die Pipelines korrodieren, erfuhr der Tagesspiegel aus Regierungskreisen.

Mehr als die Hälfte des Gases entwichen

Nach Angaben der dänischen Energiebehörde bereits mehr als die Hälfte des Gases aus den betroffenen Leitungen entwichen. Voraussichtlich am Sonntag sollen die Leitungen demnach leer sein, wie Behördenchef Kristoffer Böttzauw bei einer Pressekonferenz am Mittwoch sagte.

Wie die Behörde berechnete, entspricht die Klimabelastung des Gasaustritts etwa einem Drittel der gesamten Klimabelastung Dänemarks in einem Jahr. Ein konkretes Gesundheitsrisiko für die Bevölkerung – besonders auf der Ostsee-Insel Bornholm – bestehe aber nicht, hieß es.

Im Auswärtigen Amt berät ein Krisenstab

Inzwischen hat sich auch der Krisenstab des Auswärtigen Amtes dem Vorfall angenommen, mehrere Bundesministerien und das Kanzleramt beraten über Konsequenzen.

Als erster Schritt wird nun die Kontrolle der deutschen Hoheitsgewässer durch die Bundespolizei intensiviert, mit ihren Schiffen werden entsprechende Routen der kritischen Infrastruktur stärker beobachtet. Zudem sollen die Bundesländer den Schutz der Küstengebiete an Nord- und Ostsee verstärken. Sorge bereitet auch der Schutz der derzeit entstehenden Flüssiggas-Terminals und der Untersee- und Telekommunikationskabel.

Wie auch die EU-Kommission gehen deutsche Sicherheitsbehörden und der Auslandsgeheimdienst, der BND, von einem Sabotageakt aus. Genauso wie die Nato. Der Nato-Rat erklärte, „alle derzeit verfügbaren Informationen“ deuteten darauf hin, dass die Lecks das Ergebnis „vorsätzlicher, rücksichtsloser und unverantwortlicher Sabotageakte“ seien.

Die 30 Mitgliedstaaten des Militärbündnisses drohten mit einer „gemeinsamen und entschlossenen Reaktion“ auf jeden „vorsätzlichen Angriff auf die kritische Infrastruktur der Bündnispartner“.

Gezielte Sprengungen vermutet - führt die Spur nach Russland?

Experten und Regierungskreise glauben wegen der Komplexität des Anschlags, dass er nur durch einen staatlichen Akteur durchgeführt werden konnte. Spekulationen gehen in Richtung Russland, allerdings ist die Motivlage unklar.

Die Ukraine wirft Russland vor, es habe die Pipelines gezielt sabotiert, um die Energiekrise in Europa zu verschärfen und Panik vor dem Winter auszulösen. Dies weist die russische Regierung zurück. „Es ist ziemlich vorhersehbar und vorhersehbar dumm und absurd, solche Annahmen zu treffen“, sagt Kremlsprecher Dmitri Peskow. Er fordert zur Aufklärung der Vorfälle eine Beteiligung Russlands. Zugleich droht jedoch der russische Staatskonzern Gazprom nun mit einem Gas-Lieferstopp durch die Ukraine. - was auch wiederum die Lieferungen nach Europa weiter einschränken würde.

Von deutscher Seite ist auch der Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) an der Aufklärung beteiligt, Satellitenaufnahmen auch über mögliche Schiffsbewegungen im Vorfeld der Detonationen werden ausgewertet.

Eine Theorie ist, dass Taucher Sprengstoff an den beiden Nord-Stream-1-Röhren und einer der zwei Röhren der noch nicht in Betrieb genommenen Röhre Nord Stream 2 angebracht haben könnten. Auf gezielte Sprengungen deutet nach Tagesspiegel-Informationen hin, dass die Lecks enorm groß sind, entsprechend hoch war die Geschwindigkeit des Druckabfalls.

Zudem gibt es eine deutliche Distanz zwischen den drei Orten, an denen die Lecks entstanden sind. Durch die Größe der Lecks kann extrem viel Salzwasser in die Leitungen einströmen.

Nur eine Nord Stream 2-Röhre könnte noch Gas liefern

Zwar kam schon zuletzt kein Gas mehr über Nord Stream 1 und Nord Stream 2 war wegen des russischen Überfalls auf die Ukraine nicht in Betrieb genommen worden, aber der Fall wirft neue Fragen zur Energiesicherheit in Deutschland und Europa auf. Nach den mutmaßlichen Anschlägen stiegen die Preise für Erdgas erneut an.

Ein Nutznießer hoher Preise ist Russland mit seinem Präsidenten Wladimir Putin; zugleich hat Russland durch die kaputten Pipelines einen Milliardenschaden. Als einzige der vier Röhren ist eine Röhre von Nord Stream 2 unbeschädigt geblieben, sie ist betriebsbereit. Rein theoretisch könnte Russland einen Transport hierüber anbieten, was die Bundesregierung aber ablehnen dürfte.

Natürlich ist die kritische Infrastruktur ein potenzielles Ziel. Vizekanzler Robert Habeck

Deutschland versucht nun mit den dänischen und schwedischen Behörden die Lage weiter zu analysieren, aber es ist sehr schwierig in 70 bis 80 Meter Tiefe die entsprechenden Durchsuchungen vorzunehmen. Die deutschen Hoheitsgewässer werden vom gemeinsamen Lagezentrum See von der Bundespolizei und der Küstenwache der Länder von Cuxhaven aus gesteuert. Von dänischer Seite hieß es am Mittwoch, dass eine Untersuchung im Meer erst in ein oder zwei Wochen stattfinden könne. Auch wegen Sicherheitsbedenken.

Habeck warnt vor weiteren Anschlägen auf kritische Infrastruktur

Wirtschaftsminister Robert Habeck (Grüne) räumt derweil die Gefahr von weiteren Sabotage-Akten ein. „Natürlich ist die kritische Infrastruktur ein potenzielles Ziel“, sagte der Vizekanzler.

Das habe man in der Vergangenheit bereits erlebt, zum Beispiel bei einer Software-Attacke auf einen Windpark. Darauf habe man bereits reagiert, sagte Habeck: „Die Sicherheitsbehörden, die Dienste, dieses Haus und auch die Betreiber tun das ihrige, um die kritische Infrastruktur zu schützen und die Energieversorgung in Deutschland sicherzustellen.“

Die Sicherheitslage habe sich durch den Krieg in der Ukraine entwickelt, sagte der Wirtschaftsminister weiter. „Aber Deutschland ist ein Land, das sich zu verteidigen weiß und Europa ist ein Kontinent, der seine Energieinfrastruktur schützen kann.“ Vor allem Norwegen, derzeit einer der wichtigsten Lieferanten von Gas nach Europa hat den Schutz seiner Pipeline-System massiv verstärkt, die Pipelines sind in allen Seekarten eingezeichnet – und wegen ihrer Länge jedoch schwer zu schützen.

EU droht mit harter Reaktion – aber gegen wen ?

Auch die Europäische Union hält Sabotage als Ursache für die Lecks an den Gas-Pipelines Nord Stream 1 und 2 für wahrscheinlich und hat mit Gegenmaßnahmen gedroht.

Alle verfügbaren Informationen deuten darauf hin, dass diese Lecks das Ergebnis einer vorsätzlichen Handlung sind. Josep Borrell, EU-Außenbeauftragter

„Alle verfügbaren Informationen deuten darauf hin, dass diese Lecks das Ergebnis einer vorsätzlichen Handlung sind“, erklärte der EU-Außenbeauftragte Josep Borrell am Mittwoch im Namen der 27 Mitgliedstaaten. Jede vorsätzliche Störung der europäischen Energieinfrastruktur werde „mit einer robusten und gemeinsamen Reaktion beantwortet werden“.

EU-Kommissionspräsidentin Ursula von der Leyen hatte bereits am Dienstag nach einem Gespräch mit der dänischen Ministerpräsidentin Mette Frederiksen über „den Sabotageakt“ gesprochen. Es sei nun von größter Bedeutung, die Vorfälle zu untersuchen, um „vollständige Klarheit“ über die Geschehnisse und den Hintergrund zu erhalten, schrieb von der Leyen via Twitter.

Von der Leyen warnt vor „stärkster möglicher Reaktion“

„Jede absichtliche Störung von aktiver europäischer Energieinfrastruktur ist inakzeptabel und wird zu der stärksten möglichen Reaktion führen“, warnte die Kommissionspräsidentin. Auch Frederiksen sagte, die dänische Regierung gehe von „vorsätzlichen Handlungen“ aus.

„Unsere Fantasie gibt kein Szenario mehr her, das kein gezielter Anschlag ist“, sagte eine in die Bewertung durch die Bundesregierung eingeweihte Person dem Tagesspiegel bereits am Montag. „Alles spricht gegen einen Zufall.“

Seismographen registrierten zwei Beben – jedoch keine Hinweise auf Erdbeben

Seismologen hatten am Montag in der Nähe der festgestellten Lecks in der Ostsee Erschütterungen registriert. Ein Seismograph auf der dänischen Insel Bornholm habe zweimal ein Beben registriert - einmal um zwei Uhr morgens Ortszeit, ein weiteres Mal um 19 Uhr, teilte das deutsche Forschungszentrum GFZ am Dienstag mit.

Ob die Ausschläge des Messgeräts durch Explosionen verursacht wurden, die auf Sabotageakte an den Gasröhren hinweisen, wollte das GFZ nicht sagen. Es gebe keine Hinweise auf Erdbeben. Bjorn Lund vom Schwedischen Seismologischen Zentrum der Universität Uppsala sagte dem Sender SVT: „Es gibt keinen Zweifel, dass das Explosionen waren.“

Der dänische Klima- und Energieminister Dan Jørgensen bestätigte die Angaben der Wissenschaftler später. Die Gasleitungen lägen tief im Wasser und bestünden aus Stahl und Beton. Die Größe der Lecks deute darauf hin, dass es sich nicht um ein Unglück etwa mit einem Schiffsanker handeln könne, heißt es.

An den beiden Ostsee-Pipelines, die Gas von Russland nach Westeuropa transportieren sollen, war schon am Montag ein plötzlicher Druckabfall registriert worden.

Die dänische Marine veröffentlichte Aufnahmen, auf denen eine großflächige Blasenbildung an der Meeresoberfläche zu sehen ist. Nach den Ausschlägen auf den Messgeräten habe es ein Rauschen gegeben, sagte ein GFZ-Sprecher.

CIA soll Bundesregierung gewarnt haben

Viele Fragen werden sich nun auch an die Bundesregierung richten. Denn offenbar hat sie der US-Geheimdienst CIA schon vor Wochen vor möglichen Anschlägen auf die Erdgas-Pipelines gewarnt.

Ein solcher Hinweis des US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes sei im Sommer in Berlin eingegangen, berichtete der „Spiegel“ am Dienstag unter Berufung auf „mit dem Sachverhalt vertrauten Personen“. In Regierungskreisen hieß es gegenüber dem Tagesspiegel, die Hinweise seien nicht sehr klar gewesen.

Die Bundesnetzagentur hatte nach dem Druckabfall in der Nord-Stream-1-Pipeline erklärt, es würden keine Auswirkungen auf die Versorgungssicherheit erwartet. Die Gas-Speicherstände steigen trotz der seit vier Wochen beschickten Pipeline weiter kontinuierlich an. Sie liegen der Behörde zufolge aktuell bei rund 91 Prozent.

Wegen der Zwischenfälle bat die Behörde das staatliche Unternehmen Energinet, im Hinblick auf die Sicherheit ihrer Anlagen besonders aufmerksam zu sein. Brüche in Gasleitungen kämen höchst selten vor, weshalb man Gründe dafür sehe, das sogenannte Bereitschaftsniveau im Gas- und Stromsektor auf die zweithöchste Stufe „orange“ anzuheben, schrieb die Energiebehörde.

Kreml gibt sich „äußerst beunruhigt“

Russland selbst wollte auch nicht ausschließen, dass es sich bei den Lecks um einen Sabotageakt handelt. „Jetzt kann keine Variante ausgeschlossen werden“, sagte Kremlsprecher Dmitri Peskow am Dienstag.

Der Kreml sei „äußerst beunruhigt“ über den Druckabfall in den Ostseepipelines Nord Stream 1 und 2. „Das ist eine absolut nie dagewesene Situation, die einer schnellen Aufklärung bedarf“, sagte Peskow.

Polen und Ukraine glauben an russischen Sabotageakt

Polen erklärte am Dienstag wiederum, eine russische Provokation als Hintergrund für möglich zu halten. Man befinde sich in einer Situation hoher internationaler Spannung, sagte Vize-Außenminister Marcin Przydacz. „Leider verfolgt unser östlicher Nachbar ständig eine aggressive Politik.

Wenn er zu einer aggressiven militärischen Politik in der Ukraine fähig ist, ist es offensichtlich, dass keine Provokationen ausgeschlossen werden können, auch nicht in den Abschnitten, die in Westeuropa liegen.“

Die Ukraine wurde erwartungsgemäß noch deutlicher: „Das großflächige “Gasleck' an Nord Stream 1 ist nichts anderes als ein von Russland geplanter Terroranschlag und ein Akt der Aggression gegenüber der EU„, schrieb der ukrainische Präsidentenberater Mychailo Podoljak auf Twitter.

Der russische Gasmonopolist Gazprom hatte die Lieferungen durch Nord Stream 1 Ende August eingestellt und dadurch die Gaspreise in Europa nach oben katapultiert. Angeblich sind aufgrund der Sanktionen gegen Russland dringende Wartungsarbeiten nicht möglich.

Sowohl westliche Equipment-Lieferanten als auch die Bundesregierung bestreiten diese Darstellung. In den Berliner Sicherheitskreisen hieß es, es sei nicht auszuschließen, dass ein mutmaßlicher Anschlag schon vor dem Lieferstopp geplant worden sei, denn die Vorlaufzeiten für derartige Spezialoperationen könnten lang sein.

En savoir plus sur les anguilles

Le Thünen-Institut, par exemple, est l’un des grands organismes mondiaux de recherche sur les anguilles d’eau douce. Au sein du projet BIOEELS-TZ de MeerWissen, les chercheuses et chercheurs utilisent leur connaissance des anguilles de la zone tempérée pour étudier les espèces tropicales. Plus de 40 espèces des poissons de type anguille vivent en Tanzanie dont certaines sont menacées. Pour les préserver, on étudie par exemple la diversité biologique des anguilles migratrices dans les rivières côtières.

L’université de Dar-es-Salam et le TAFIRI dirigent l’aspect socio-économique du projet car BIOEELS-TZ associe biologie et sociologie. Interviewer les pêcheurs fait ainsi partie du travail de recherche. Les anguilles étant sensibles aux modifications de leur environnement et la population tanzanienne devant croître fortement, la préservation des anguilles, la protection de leur biotope et une pêche durable sont importantes.

Leider sind Ölteppiche auf Gewässern keine Seltenheit – für die Umwelt sind sie eine Katastophe. Ein Friseur aus Frankreich hat eine ungewöhnliche Idee, um zu helfen. Inzwischen unterstützen ihn Salons aus zahlreichen europäischen Ländern dabei – auch in Deutschland.

Abfall in Meeren ist ein riesiges Umweltproblem. Doch bestimmter Müll eignet sich vielleicht auch zum Schutz von Gewässern – zumindest gemäß der Idee von Thierry Gras. Der französische Friseur gründete 2015 den Verein „Coiffeures justes“ (auf deutsch „Faire Friseure“). Mitglieder sammeln abgeschnittene Haare in Beuteln, anstelle sie wegzuwerfen. Die Haare sollen später als Filtermaterial genutzt werden, um zum Beispiel Öl aus Gewässern aufzusaugen.

Coiffeures justes: Haareschneiden für die Umwelt

Ausgelaufenes Öl kann Meerestieren zum Verhängnis werden. (Foto: CC0/pixabay/ dennisflarsen)

Unsere Haare sind sehr saugfähig – und deshalb zu schade für die Tonne. Damit sie genutzt werden können, hat Thierry Gras folgendes System entwickelt:

Die europäischen Friseursalons, die zu den „Coiffeures justes“ gehören, können auf der offiziellen Website Papierbeutel bestellen. Sobald die Beutel gefüllt sind, werden sie an eine zentrale Sammelstelle geschickt. Dort werden sie in überschüssige orthopädische Strümpfe gefüllt und zu Rollen verarbeitet.

Diese Rollen sollen besonders effektiv Fett aufsagen – weil sie aus menschlichem Haar bestehen. Wie das ZDF bereits 2020 berichtete, sollen sich die Rollen zudem bis zu acht Mal wiederverwenden lassen. Nach Benutzung werden sie in Wäschereien gereinigt.

Soweit die Theorie. Praktisch eingesetzt wurden die Haarfilter zum Beispiel im Rahmen eines Pilotprojekts am Hafenort Cavalaire-sur-Mer an der Côte d’Azur. In der Nähe einer Sportboot-Tankstelle dienten sie dazu, verschüttetes Öl und Benzin aus dem Meerwasser aufzusaugen. Ein Bild der Strümpfe im Einsatz gibt es auf Facebook zu sehen. Im August 2020 sandte Thierry Gras außerdem 20 Tonnen Haare nach Mauritius, wo ein verunglückter Frachter mehrere hundert Tonnen Öl verloren hatte.

Thierry sieht viele weitere Einsatzmöglichkeiten für Schnitthaare. Ein Werbefilm auf der Website stellt zum Beispiel vor, wie die Haare auch als Düngemittel oder Isolierungsmaterial verwendet werden können.

Welche Salons machen mit?

Laut offizieller Website nehmen „tausende“ Friseursalons bereits an der Aktion teil. Eine Karte, auf der man teilnehmende Salons finden kann, zeigt an die 5000 Treffer. Der Großteil davon befindet sich in Frankreich, doch auch in größeren Städten in Deutschland gibt es Treffer.

Dazu wurde es erweitert und in östlicher Richtung bis Cala Figuera ausgedehnt.

Das Landwirtschaftsministerium hat in einer Erklärung den guten ökologischen Zustand von Cala Rafalbeig sowie die wertvollen Lebensräume betont, die das Gebiet beherbergt: Unter anderem sorgen Poseidongras und Korallen dafür, dass sich dort eine artenreiche Fischpopulation beobachten lässt.

Das Dekret zum Zusammenschluss und zur Ausdehnung des Meeresschutzgebiets ist am Samstag (12.2.) öffentlich gemacht worden. Sollte es in den kommenden zwei Wochen keine Einwände mehr geben, wird es in Kraft treten.

Neu ist dabei, dass für jedes der Reservate eine spezielle Tauchzone eingerichtet wird. Eine gemeinsame Überwachungskommission soll die der bisherigen separaten Schutzgebiete ersetzen.

Außergewöhnlich große Fischbestände

El Toro und der Malgrats im Südwesten von Mallorca wurden 2004 von der Regierung zu Meeresschutzgebieten erklärt. Seitdem wurden sie regelmäßig von Wissenschaftlern und Fischern überwacht, die sofort ein außergewöhnliches Anwachsen der Bestände von dort ansässigen Fischarten feststellen konnten.

So ist der Bestand der Zackenbarsche von El Toro heute beispielsweise rund 52 Mal höher als noch im Jahr 2004. Wie bei allen durch die Fischerei gefährdeten Fischarten war deren Vorkommen in diesem Schutzgebiet im Jahr 2020 das höchste, das jemals an der balearischen Küste registriert wurde.

Im September 2020 beschloss die Vollversammlung des Stadtrats von Calvià mit großer Mehrheit, die Regierung dazu aufzufordern, die Schutzgebiete zusammenzulegen und auszudehnen. Das neue Meeresschutzgebiet von El Toro und Malgrats soll nun dazu beitragen, dass sich die kommerziellen Fischbestände im Südwesten Mallorcas noch besser erholen, wovon letztlich natürlich auch die Fischer profitieren.

Nun hat sich der Professor der Universität Nagasaki einem der größten Probleme für maritimes Leben verschrieben: der Beseitigung von Plastik in Ozeanen.

Voriges Jahr stellte sein Team ein Tauchrobotersystem vor, das mit einem autonomen Schiffsroboter (ASV) und einem ferngesteuerten Unterwasserroboter (ROV) zusammenarbeitet, um die Wasseroberfläche, das Wasser selbst sowie den Meeresboden nach Müll absucht.

Meeresmüll automatisiert entsorgen

""Durch diese Integration des neu entwickelten ASV und ROV haben wir einen Schiffsroboter entwickelt, der Meeresmüll effizienter als je zuvor untersuchen kann"", erklärte das Team die Bedeutung ihrer Entwicklung, die sich nun in der Erprobung befindet. Das eigentliche Ziel ist allerdings höher gesteckt: Yamamoto will damit zur Entwicklung eines Systems beitragen, dass die Entsorgung von Meeresmüll automatisiert.

Post aus Japan Japan probiert mit Elektronik seit jeher alles Mögliche aus - und oft auch das Unmögliche. Jeden Donnerstag berichtet unser Autor Martin Kölling an dieser Stelle über die neuesten Trends aus Japan und den Nachbarstaaten. Mehr Artikel zu ""Post aus Japan""

Plastikmüll ist schon lange eine Pest der Meere. Dabei handelt es sich nicht nur um die Massen an Tüten, Flaschen und anderen Materialien, die an der Meeresoberfläche oder unter Wasser treiben. Fische schlucken die Polymere, entweder ganz oder fein zerrieben in Mikropartikel und sammeln so Plastik in der Nahrungskette an.

Zudem sinkt ein Großteil des Mülls auf den Meeresboden. 80 Millionen Tonnen sollen sich bereits angesammelt haben, schreibt der World Wildlife Fund. Weltweit versuchen daher verschiedene Projekte, das Problem zu lösen. Professor Yamamoto ist dabei seit 2019 federführend an einem der ambitioniertesten japanischen Vorhaben beteiligt: dem ""Projekt Ikkaku"" (Projekt Narwal).

Dabei handelt es sich laut den Organisatoren um einen ""hyper-interdisziplinäres"" Versuch, die Herausforderung Meeresmüll umfassend mit drei Teams anzugehen. Die ""Debris-Watcher"" entwickeln Techniken, um das schädliche Treibgut aufzuspüren. Team 2 entwickelt autonome Systeme, die selbst Mikroplastik aufnehmen und recyceln können. Team 3 sucht nach Ideen, aus dem Müll Produkte herzustellen, die die Menschen auch emotional für die Problematik sensibilisieren.

Mit Tauchrobotern auf dem Meeresboden suchen

Yamamoto ist der Vizechef der ersten Arbeitsgruppe. Ein Manko war bisher, dass die Spurensuche aus der Luft mit Satelliten oder Drohnen oder auf dem Meer mit Schiffen stattfinden muss. Mit Tauchrobotern kann die Suche auch kostengünstiger auf den Meeresboden ausgedehnt werden.

Yamamotos Labor hat daher bisherige Tauchroboter für Unterwasserinspektionen für die neue Aufgabe weiterentwickelt. Das erste Ergebnis ist ein System, das aus zwei Fahrzeugen besteht. Das Hauptgerät, gewissermaßen das Mutterschiff, ist ungefähr 1,40 Meter lang, 1,1 Meter breit, 30 Kilogramm schwer und schwimmt an der Oberfläche.

Es dient damit nicht nur als Startposition eines fernbedienten Tauchroboters, sondern kann mit einer schwenkbaren Kamera auch die Meeresoberfläche überwachen. Mit dem Mini-U-Boot können die maritimen Müllmänner und -frauen dann in Echtzeit die Gewässer, Riffe und den Boden nach Plastik durchsuchen.

Künftige Roboter sollen auch Wasserproben entnehmen

Das System kann auch für andere Unterwasserinspektionen eingesetzt werden, zum Beispiel von Brückenpfeilern, schwimmenden Windkraft- oder Hafenanlagen. Als nächsten Schritt will Yamamoto einen Roboter entwickeln, der automatisch Wasserproben einsammelt. Yamamoto ist zuversichtlich für seine Ideen.

Diese Meeresmüllroboter könnten genaue Bilder von der Menge und der Lage des Mülls machen, sogar entlang einer komplizierten Küstenlinie, die für Menschen schwer zugänglich ist, erklärte er gegenüber japanischen Medien. ""Durch die Zusammenarbeit von Regierung, Industrie und Wissenschaft möchten wir der Welt die Effektivität dieser Roboter zeigen und sie populär machen.""

Massen an Plastikmüll, Überfischung, Erhitzung - die Weltmeere sind schwer belastet. Bei einem internationalen Gipfeltreffen in Frankreich wurden zahlreiche Initiativen zum Schutz der Ozeane angestoßen.

Die internationale Gemeinschaft will sich stärker für den Schutz der Weltmeere engagieren. Im französischen Brest berieten zahlreiche Staats- und Regierungschef etwa über Schritte gegen Plastikmüll in den Meeren und Überfischung.

Frankreich sprach im Anschluss von ""wichtigen Verpflichtungen"", die im Rahmen des ""One Ocean Summit"" eingegangen wurden. Zu dem dreitägigen Gipfel hatte Präsident Emmanuel Macron eingeladen, mit Unterstützung der Vereinten Nationen.

Viele Vorhaben angekündigt

Die EU-Staaten wollen sich gemeinsam mit weiteren Ländern dafür einsetzen, dass noch in diesem Jahr ein Abkommen zur nachhaltigen Nutzung und zum Schutz der Biodiversität auf hoher See geschlossen wird.

14 Teilnehmerstaaten sagten zu, den Kampf gegen illegalen Fischfang zu verstärken, unter anderem durch bessere Kontrollen in Häfen und auf See. Die Mittelmeerländer wollen sich zudem für die Schaffung einer Zone mit niedrigen Schwefelemissionen stark machen.

Bundesregierung will Meeresbeauftragten

Die Bundesregierung hatte bereits gestern in Brest angekündigt, mit einer ""Meeresstrategie"" mehr gegen die Verschmutzung der Ozeane tun zu wollen. Ein Meeresbeauftragter soll dabei die Koordination der Meerespolitik übernehmen, wie Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke sagte.

Macron erklärte, sein Land habe die Schutzgebiete in den französischen Süd- und Antarktisgebieten ausgedehnt. Dazu habe sich Frankreich als Teil der Naturschutz-Koalition ""High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People"" verpflichtet.

Sie wurde 2019 von Costa Rica, Frankreich und Großbritannien mit dem Ziel gegründet, bis 2030 jeweils mindestens 30 Prozent des Landes und der Weltmeere unter Schutz zu stellen. Inzwischen gehören der Koalition 84 Länder an, darunter auch Deutschland.

Umweltaktivisten zwiegespalten

Die Umweltorganisation WWF wertete den Gipfel in einer ersten Einschätzung als wichtiges politisches Zeichen. Die Bedeutung der Ozeane in der Klimakrise scheine angekommen zu sein. Dennoch sei es traurig, dass die Politik bei den Diskussionen um ein Moratorium für den Tiefseebergbau überhaupt nicht vorangekommen sei.

Auch Klimaschutzaktivisten von Greenpeace forderten Macron bei Protesten in Brest auf, ein Moratorium zu unterstützen. Schade sei, dass der Gipfel im Ergebnis vage geblieben sei - nötig seien jedoch konkrete Maßnahmen.

Wichtige Rolle der Meere beim Klimaschutz

Meere und Ozeane decken etwa 70 Prozent der Erdoberfläche ab und spielen eine entscheidende Rolle für das Klima. Sie absorbieren schädliche Kohlendioxid-Emissionen und speichern Wärme, die durch Strömungen und Wind rund um den Globus verteilt wird.

Zugleich werden sie stark vom Klimawandel getroffen. Die hohen CO2-Ausstoße haben in den vergangen Dekaden zu einer Versauerung und Erhitzung der Weltmeere geführt, was Ökosysteme bedroht und zu Wirbelstürmen beiträgt.

In den kommenden Monaten sind zahlreiche weitere internationale Zusammenkünfte geplant, die dem Meeresschutz gewidmet sind. Frankreich zufolge sollte der Gipfel in Brest dazu dienen, vorab eine gemeinsame Vision zu entwickeln. Neben Vertretern von etwa 100 Ländern kamen in dem französischen Hafenort auch Persönlichkeiten aus Wirtschaft, Wissenschaft und Zivilgesellschaft zusammen.

Die Ozeane machen die Erde für die Menschheit lebenswert. Regenwasser, Trinkwasser, Wetter, Klima, Küsten, ein Großteil unserer Nahrung und sogar der Sauerstoff in der Luft werden vom Meer bereitgestellt und reguliert. Ein sorgfältiger Umgang mit dieser wichtigen globalen Ressource ist ein wichtiger Baustein einer nachhaltigen Zukunft. Leider kommt es momentan jedoch zu einer kontinuierlichen Verschlechterung der Küstengewässer durch Verschmutzung.

Die Hevert-Foundation unterstützt deswegen die Cleanup-Missions von everwave, einem Verein und Start-up, dessen Ziel es ist, die Zuläufe der Meere zu reinigen und den Plastikmüll zu recyceln. Ein Team aus Wissenschaftlern, Architekten, Ingenieuren und Meeresliebhabern setzt sich bei Everwave mit Herzblut für den Schutz unserer Ozeane ein. Mit ihrem Team reinigen sie Flüsse mit speziell umgebauten Booten und mittels KI (Künstliche Intelligenz) wird das Plastik recycelt und wieder in den Kreislauf gebracht.

Ein Teil der Mission ist die Aufklärung in Schulen, die Everwave mit der Unterstützung von Hevert mit einem Umweltbildungskoffer für den interaktiven Unterricht unterstützt, so dass die Kinder für das Thema Meeresschutz und Kreislaufwirtschaft sensibilisiert werden.

Zwei Drittel der Meeresgebiete befinden sich außerhalb nationaler Hoheitsgebiete. Verhandlungen zum Schutz der Hochsee sind nun gescheitert – erneut.

BERLIN taz/ap/afp | Di­plo­ma­t:in­nen aus der ganzen Welt haben sich auch nach einer fünften Verhandlungsrunde nicht auf ein UN-Hochseeabkommen zum Schutz der Weltmeere einigen können. Die Verhandlungen am UN-Sitz in New York wurden am Wochenende nach zweiwöchigen Gesprächen ausgesetzt. Um­welt­schüt­ze­r:in­nen hatten gehofft, mit einem Abkommen eine Lücke im internationalen Schutz der Meere zu schließen.

Seit 15 Jahren verhandeln die UN-Mitgliedstaaten über ein Abkommen zum Schutz der Biodiversität in der Hochsee. Es geht dabei um die Teile der Weltmeere, die weiter als 370 Kilometer von der nächsten Küste entfernt sind. Damit fallen sie nicht in die hoheitliche Wirtschaftszone eines Staates. Das trifft auf 60 Prozent der Meeresgebiete zu – und nur etwa ein Prozent davon wird aktuell durch internationale Abkommen geschützt. Bei den Verhandlungen sollten weitere Schutzzonen in den Meeren vereinbart werden.

Zu den sensibelsten Themen gehört dabei die Aufteilung möglicher Gewinne durch genetische Ressourcen in internationalen Gewässern, in denen Pharma-, Chemie- und Kosmetikindustrie auf den Fund von neuen hochwirksamen Substanzen hoffen. Die kostspielige Suche danach können sich nur internationale Großkonzerne oder reiche Nationen leisten. Doch ärmere Länder wehren sich dagegen, von möglichen Gewinnen ausgeschlossen zu werden. Sie argumentieren, dass der Reichtum der Meere allen gehöre. Nach Angaben aus Diplomatenkreisen waren die Gespräche dabei zwischenzeitlich gut vorangekommen, einige Streitfragen blieben aber ungeklärt.

Umweltschutzorganisationen zeigten sich enttäuscht vom Ausgang der Verhandlungen. Die Leiterin der Greenpeace-Kampagne zum Schutz der Meere, Laura Meller, warf wohlhabenden Ländern wie den Vereinigten Staaten vor, nicht schnell genug Kompromisse einzugehen. Russland habe eine Blockadehaltung eingenommen und sich geweigert, am Vertragsprozess teilzuhaben oder eine Einigung mit der EU und anderen Ländern in vielen Fragen zu suchen.

Laura Meller, Greenpeace „Länder wie die USA haben sich zu langsam bewegt“

„Länder wie die USA haben sich trotz ihrer Zusagen zu langsam bewegt, um Kompromisse zu finden.“ Eine weitere Verzögerung bedeute nun die Zerstörung der Meere. Laut Greenpeace müssen bis 2030 jährlich 11 Millionen Quadratkilometer Ozean geschützt werden, um 30 Prozent der Weltmeere in dem Zeitraum zu schützen, den Wis­sen­schaft­le­r:in­nen für notwendig hielten. Die Umweltorganisation fordert, eine Dringlichkeitssitzung einzuberufen. Ansonsten werden die Gespräche erst wieder im kommenden Jahr aufgenommen.

„Wir müssen weitermachen“

Auch Karoline Schacht, Meeresschutzexpertin beim WWF Deutschland, kritisiert das Scheitern der Verhandlungen: „Die Möglichkeit, 30 Prozent der Ozeane bis zum Jahr 2030 zu schützen, wurde in diesen Tagen verschenkt und rückt in weite Ferne.“ Schacht sieht jedoch auch Positives. In vielen Bereichen seien Fortschritte erzielt worden, etwa „die Verpflichtung zur verstärkten Zusammenarbeit und zum ökosystembasierten Management sowie wichtige Bestimmungen rund um die Einrichtung von Meeresschutzgebieten auf der Hohen See“.

Die stellvertretende US-Außenministerin Monica Medina äußerte sich ebenfalls enttäuscht, hoffte aber, die geleistete Arbeit fortsetzen zu können. Die USA verfolgten weiterhin das Ziel, bis 2030 mindestens 30 Prozent der Weltmeere unter Schutz zu stellen. „Wir dürfen nicht zulassen, dass die Gezeiten und Strömungen uns zurückdrängen. Wir müssen weitermachen“, sagte sie.

Auf Einladung von Portugal und Kenia kommt die globale Meeresschutz-Community zusammen. Angesichts des dramatischen Zustands der Meere und dem daraus entstehenden Handlungsdruck ist das Ziel, anstehende zentrale Regierungsverhandlungen zum Schutz der Meere politisch zu flankieren, und wirksame Maßnahmen zum Schutz der Meere vorzubereiten.

Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke: ""Gesunde Meere sind für uns Menschen überlebenswichtig. Wenn wir das Zerstören der Meere nicht beenden, gefährden wir nicht nur wunderbare Naturschätze, sondern auch unsere eigenen Lebengrundlagen. Meeresschutz hilft uns im Kampf gegen die Klimakrise, die Verschmutzungskrise und das Artenaussterben. Deshalb müssen wir vom Reden ins Handeln kommen und dem Meeresschutz viel höhere Priorität einräumen. Wir müssen übergreifender denken und den Schutz der Meere und Ozeane sowie die natur- und umweltverträgliche Nutzung miteinander in Einklang bringen. Zur Stärkung des Meeresschutzes in Deutschland erarbeiten wir deshalb eine nationale Meeresstrategie. Eine eigene Unterabteilung Meeresschutz innerhalb des Ministeriums befindet sich gerade im Aufbau. Außerdem wird noch in diesem Sommer der erste Meeresbeauftragte der Bundesregierung seine Arbeit aufnehmen.""

International setzt sich die Bundesregierung dafür ein, das Ziel, 30 Prozent der Meere bis 2030 wirksam zu schützen, auf der Weltnaturkonferenz im Dezember in Montreal verbindlich zu beschließen. Meeresschutzgebiete sind eines der wichtigsten Instrumente, um die Vielfalt der Meere und ihre ökologischen Funktionen zu erhalten. Die Qualität der Schutzgebiete ist dabei von besonderer Bedeutung. Die Bundesregierung hat deshalb im Koalitionsvertrag verankert, in den Meeresschutzgebieten der deutschen Nord- und Ostsee Zonen auszuweisen, die besonders streng geschützt und frei von schädlicher Nutzung sind. Außerdem hat die Umsetzung von Maßnahmen in den Schutzgebieten der Nord- und Ostsee bereits begonnen.

Neben der Generaldebatte der Weltozeankonferenz, den inhaltlichen Dialogreihen und Side-Events, dient die Konferenz insbesondere dazu, mehr und konsequentere Maßnahmen der Länder anzustoßen und eigene Maßnahmen (Pledges) zuzusagen. Im Vorfeld der UN Ozean Konferenz haben die G7-Umweltminister*innen unter deutscher Präsidentschaft und auf Initiative von Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke einen G7 Ocean Deal verabschiedet. Im Ocean Deal haben die G7-Staaten eine erhebliche Ambitionssteigerung verabredet und sich klar zu den wichtigen laufenden Meeres-Verhandlungsprozessen positioniert. In den nächsten Monaten stehen die letzten Verhandlungsrunden für wichtige internationale Abkommen an: Das globale Abkommen zum Schutz der Biodiversität auf Hoher See (BBNJ) soll abschließend in New York im August verhandelt werden, der neue globale Rahmen für die Biologische Vielfalt auf der Weltnaturkonferenz in Montreal im Dezember.

Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke wird die Weltozeankonferenz nutzen, um weitere Aspekte der Anfang des Jahres bereits angekündigten Meeresoffensive für Deutschland zuzusagen. Dazu gehören:

eine verbindliche nationale Meeresstrategie,

die Benennung eines Meeresbeauftragten der Bundesregierung,

der Aufbau einer Unterabteilung Meeresschutz im Bundesumweltministerium,

ein Sofortprogramm für die Bergung von Munitionsaltlasten in Nord- und Ostsee,

substantielle Mittel für die Wiederherstellung von marinen und Küstenökosystemen im Rahmen des Aktionsprogramms Natürlicher Klimaschutz,

der Beitritt zu der Vorreiter-Allianz ""Blue Leaders"",

der Einsatz für den Abschluss des globalen Abkommens zum Schutz der Biodiversität auf Hoher See (BBNJ),

EU-Parlament fordert Maßnahmen für Meeresschutz: Deutschland

muss vorlegen

Von Environmental Justice Foundation Deutschland

Diese Woche hat das Europäische Parlament die EU in zwei wichtigen Abstimmungen aufgefordert, gegen die Schäden, die Grundschleppnetzfischerei für das Leben im Meer und für ein stabiles Klima verursacht, vorzugehen und sämtliche schädlichen extraktiven industriellen Aktivitäten in Meeresschutzgebieten zu verbieten.

Dieses starke Signal zeigt, dass die politische Dynamik beim Thema Meeresschutz weiter zunimmt und Länder weltweit sich dafür einsetzen müssen, den Schutz des Ozeans Realität werden zu lassen. Insbesondere Deutschland hat als wichtiger Akteur innerhalb der EU und durch seinen Vorsitz der G7 die Möglichkeit, diese Versprechen in konkrete, ehrgeizige Maßnahmen umzusetzen.

„Der aktuelle Stand der Schutzmaßnahmen für den Ozean auf internationaler Ebene ist beschämend, besonders innerhalb der Europäischen Union“, so EJF Geschäftsführer und Gründer Steve Trent. „Weniger als 1% der EU-Gewässer sind vor zerstörerischen Praktiken wie der Grundschleppnetzfischerei geschützt. Studien zeigen sogar, dass Schleppnetzfischerei innerhalb sogenannter ‘geschützter’ Gebiete 1,4-mal intensiver ist. Dieses Ausmaß der Zerstörung gefährdet sowohl unser Klima als auch das unersetzliche Leben im Meer.“ „Durch seine G7-Präsidentschaft hat Deutschland die einzigartige Möglichkeit, Länder zu vereinen, um das Klima, die Fischerei und marine Ökosysteme zu schützen“, so Trent weiter. „Bei den G7-Treffen im Sommer, der UN-Biodiversitätskonferenz im Herbst und bei Diskussionen innerhalb der EU muss Deutschland verbindliche und messbare Ziele für die Wiederherstellung und den Erhalt der biologischen Vielfalt setzen. Insbesondere muss die Grundschleppnetzfischerei in Meeresschutzgebieten gestoppt werden.”

Vera Coelho, Senior Director für Advocacy bei Oceana Europe, sagte: „Auch wenn Deutschland in der Theorie das 30-Prozent-Ziel für Meeresschutz übertroffen hat, ist nur ein sehr geringer Teil dieser Gebiete effektiv vor destruktiven Praktiken wie der Grundschleppnetzfischerei geschützt. So wurden beispielsweise im Jahr 2021 im niedersächsischen Wattenmeer – ein Schutzgebiet, das sowohl als Nationalpark als auch als Natura 2000-Gebiet und UNESCO-Weltnaturerbe ausgewiesen ist – über 22.000 Stunden Schleppnetzfischerei innerhalb seiner Grenzen verzeichnet.“ „Die Weltnaturschutzunion (IUCN) stuft die Grundschleppnetzfischerei ausdrücklich als industrielle Fischerei ein, und industrielle Fischerei ist mit keiner Art von Meeresschutzgebiet vereinbar. Die Bundesregierung ist ehrgeizige Verpflichtungen zum Schutz der Meere eingegangen. Jetzt muss sie mit gutem Beispiel vorangehen und ihre MPAs wirklich vor destruktiver Fischerei schützen.”

Sie unterstützen darin den G7 Ocean Deal und bitten die G7-UmweltministerInnen bis Ende des Jahres über die Fortschritte Bericht zu erstatten. Damit senden die G7-Staaten ein wichtiges Signal Richtung Lissabon, wo sich in dieser Woche auf der Weltozeankonferenz der Vereinten Nationen die internationale Meeres-Community versammelt um gemeinsam einen wirksamen Schutz der Meere und Ozeane voranzubringen.

Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke: ""Der Schutz der Meere ist von herausragender Bedeutung im Kampf gegen die Klimakrise, die Verschmutzungskrise und das Artenaussterben. Die G7-Staaten beanspruchen mit der Verabschiedung des Ocean Deal eine Führungsrolle zum Schutz der Meere und müssen nun konkrete Maßnahmen zur Umsetzung dieser Ambitionen folgen lassen. Dafür treten wir auch auf der Weltozeankonferenz in Lissabon an.""

Auf der Weltozeankonferenz der Vereinten Nationen, die vom 27. Juni bis zum 1. Juli in Lissabon stattfindet, wird Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke die Ergebnisse der laufenden G7-Präsidentschaft mit Blick auf den Meeresschutz präsentieren und damit den Anspruch der G7, eine Führungsrolle beim internationalen Meeresschutz einzunehmen, untermauern.

Der Ocean Deal wurde Ende Mai auf Initiative von Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke durch die G7-Umweltminister*innen verabschiedet. Im Ocean Deal haben die G7-Staaten eine erhebliche Ambitionssteigerung verabredet, sich klar zu den wichtigsten laufenden Meeres-Verhandlungsprozessen positioniert und Maßnahmen zur Umsetzung von ambitioniertem Meeresschutz angekündigt.

Hierzu fordern die G7, die Verhandlungen für ein globales Abkommen zum Schutz der Biodiversität auf Hoher See (BBNJ) noch in diesem Jahr zum Abschluss zu bringen. Sie bekennen sich erstmals zu besonders streng geschützten Meeresgebieten und drängen darauf, im Rahmen der Verhandlungen auf der Weltnaturkonferenz in Montreal das Ziel festzuschreiben, 30 Prozent der Meere bis 2030 unter Schutz zu stellen.

Auf einem Forschungsschiff vor der Insel Santa Cruz unterzeichnete Präsident Guillermo Lasso das entsprechende Dekret. Mit dabei waren der frühere US-Präsident Bill Clinton und Kolumbiens Staatschef Ivan Duque.

Das neue Schutzgebiet namens ""Hermandad"" (Bruderschaft) erweitert das 138.000 Quadratkilometer große Schutzgebiet um die Galapagos-Inseln, das bereits seit 1998 besteht. Das Areal, in dem industrielle Fischerei verboten ist, ist mit nun 198.000 Quadratkilometern das zweitgrößte Meeresschutzgebiet der Welt. Es soll noch durch weitere Schutzgebiete im angrenzenden Kolumbien und in Panama ergänzt werden, um ein internationales Biosphärenreservat zu schaffen.

""Es gibt Orte, die die Geschichte der Menschheit prägen, und heute haben wir die Ehre, an einem dieser Orte zu sein"", sagte Lasso. ""Diese Inseln lehren uns etwas über uns selbst: Was wäre, wenn wir uns nicht als Herren über diese Erde aufführten, sondern als ihr Beschützer?""

Lasso hatte das Projekt im November bei der Weltklimakonferenz in Glasgow angekündigt. Die Galapagos-Inseln gehören zu Ecuador und liegen rund 1000 Kilometer westlich der südamerikanischen Küste im Pazifik.

Mit der Aktionswoche engagiert sich der Versicherer für den Schutz der Meere.

Mit den Schiffen „Gebrüder“ und „Seestern“ geht es in der Geisterwoche raus auf See, um gemeinsam mit sogenannten „ghost divern“ (Geistertauchern) Geisternetze aus dem Meer zu fischen. Dabei handelt es sich um alte, kaputte Fischernetze, die durch’s Wasser „geistern“ und dabei eine Gefahr für die Meeresbewohner darstellen. Außerdem ist auch das Mikroplastik, dass sie ins Wasser abgeben nicht besonders gesund. Neben Lenard von Stockhausen, finanzwelt, sind auch Henning Bernau und Daniel Feddermann von den NV-Versicherungen, Michael Schillinger, Vorstand der Inter Versicherungsgruppe, sowie Stefan Bratek, Bereichsleiter Marketing Inter Versicherungsgruppe, und Vertreter von rhion.digital mit von der Partie.

Insgesamt beteiligen sich ca. 25 Freiwillige an der Aktion. Bei einem Probedurchlauf gestern konnten bereits 30 kg Geisternetze aus dem Meer geborgen werden, dabei setzte der Wellengang einigen Helfern ganz schön zu – doch was in Neuharlingersiel passiert, bleibt in Neuharlingersiel.

236,2022-06-30,Eine Dekade für den Meeresschutz,https://internationalepolitik.de/de/eine-dekade-fuer-den-meeresschutz,8,0,8,0,internationalepolitik.de,Germany,"Die Vereinten Nationen haben den Zeitraum 2021 bis 2030 zur Dekade der Meeresforschung für nachhaltige Entwicklung erklärt: Auf höchster internationaler Ebene sollen neue Lösungen zum Schutz der Ozeane und ihrer Nutzung umgesetzt werden. Rund 70 Prozent unseres „Blauen Planeten“ sind von Wasser bedeckt. Jeder zweite Atemzug, den wir nehmen, stammt aus dem Meer.

Die Ozeane sind für die Menschhei ein wichtiger Verbündeter, sei es im Kampf gegen die Klimakrise, beim Erhalt der globalen Biodiversität und auch als zentraler wirtschaftlicher und kultureller Faktor. Doch bislang fehlt es an politischem Willen, dieses „Lebenserhaltungssystem“ ernsthaft und ausreichend zu schützen.



Politisch betrachtet ist das Meer sowohl nationales Gebiet als auch Allgemeingut. Die Bereiche des Küstenmeeres und der „Ausschließlichen Wirtschaftszone“ eines Landes können bis zu 200 Seemeilen ins Meer hineinreichen. Etwa zwei Drittel der Meeresoberfläche sind keinem Staat und keiner anderen politischen Einheit zugeordnet. Die internationalen Gebiete jenseits der 200-Seemeilen-Grenze gehören zur Hohen See und sind nach dem UN-Seerechtsübereinkommen als „gemeinsames Erbe der Menschheit“ definiert.



Sowohl in nationalen als auch in internationalen Gewässern wecken das Meer und seine Ressourcen Begehrlichkeiten. Das beginnt beim Transport von Waren auf dem Seeweg, betrifft die Jagd nach Fisch, der als Allgemeingut durch die Weltmeere zieht und keine Staatengrenzen respektiert und endet bei der Suche nach wertvollen Rohstoffen in der Tiefsee. Weil sich das Meer nicht als eine politische oder wirtschaftliche Einheit betrachten lässt, gestaltet sich die Durchsetzung von politisch verhandelten Maßnahmen häufig schwierig. Obwohl zahlreiche Maßnahmenpakete für effektiven Meeresschutz entwickelt wurden, haben die wenigsten davon bislang Wirkung im Wasser entfaltet. Interessenkonflikte, fehlende Finanzierung und politischer Handel bis hin zur Handlungsunfähigkeit in internationalen Gremien setzen die Gesundheit der Ozeane und die Leistungen ihrer Ökosysteme zum Wohle von uns Menschen aufs Spiel.



Als weltweit größter Kohlenstoffspeicher haben die Ozeane in den vergangenen 200 Jahren ein Drittel des durch menschliche Aktivitäten erzeugten CO2 und 90 Prozent der zusätzlichen Wärme absorbiert, die durch die menschengemachte steigende Konzentration von Treibhausgasen in der Atmosphäre gehalten wurde. Die Wärmeaufnahme durch den Ozean stellt auf diese Weise einen Puffer bei Klimaveränderungen dar und verlangsamt die Erhitzung der Atmosphäre.



Zudem trägt das Meer zur globalen Ernährungssicherheit bei, Fisch spielt dabei eine immens wichtige Rolle. Für über 3,1 Milliarden Menschen liefert er wenigstens 20 Prozent des tierischen Eiweißes, ist aber vor allem eine wichtige Quelle von Fettsäuren und Spurenelementen. Fisch liefert heute 17 Prozent des gesamten weltweit konsumierten Proteins. Und auch sozioökonomisch ist er wichtig: Rund 500 Millionen Menschen verdienen mit und in der Fischerei ihren Lebensunterhalt.



Zusätzlich nutzen wir die Ozeane immer intensiver für den Waren- und Gütertransport. Der Seeverkehr hat sich zwischen 1992 und 2013 verdreifacht und steigt weiter. Öl und Gas werden aus den Weltmeeren gefördert, andere Rohstoffe wie Sand und Kies abgebaut. Um den Ausstieg aus fossilen Brennstoffen zu ermöglichen, scheint ein massiver Ausbau der ­Offshore-Windparks unerlässlich. Und nicht zuletzt suchen Millionen von Menschen die Küstenregionen auf, um hier ihren Urlaub zu verbringen – der Tourismus ist ein riesiger Wirtschaftszweig.



Ozean in der Krise

Doch der Raubbau bringt das System, an dem die Wertschöpfung und Ernährungssicherheit der Weltgemeinschaft hängt, an den Rand des Kollapses. Die Meere werden wärmer, saurer und sauerstoffärmer. Der Verlust der Artenvielfalt schreitet im Meer deutlich schneller voran als an Land. Infolge all dessen nehmen Ökosystemleistungen, Fischbestände und die Produktivität in den Meeren fortlaufend und in dramatischer Weise ab. Die aktuellen Sachstandsberichte des Weltklimarats IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) sagen es ganz deutlich: Die Klimaerhitzung ist längst da und ihre Auswirkungen auf Menschen und Ökosysteme sind deutlich spürbar. UN-Generalsekretär António Guterres fand zur Veröffentlichung des IPCC-Berichts im Februar 2022 deutliche Worte: „Fast die Hälfte der Menschheit lebt bereits jetzt in der Gefahrenzone. Viele Ökosysteme sind bereits jetzt an dem Punkt, an dem es kein Zurück mehr gibt.“



Die Effekte der Klimaerhitzung auf Land-, Süßwasser- und Meeresökosysteme sind größer als bisher angenommen: Tropische Korallenriffe und Seetangwälder sterben ab und viele Arten verlagern ihren Lebensraum in kühlere, polnahe Gebiete. Die Kohlendioxidemissionen als zentrale Treiber der Erwärmung waren zwischen 2010 und 2019 noch höher als in jedem anderen Jahrzehnt seit Aufzeichnungsbeginn. Dabei sollten sie längst sinken.



Von den Folgen der Klimakrise sind zwar alle Ökosysteme und Regionen betroffen, besonders stark jedoch Menschen und Regionen im globalen Süden – dort, wo der Beitrag zur globalen Klimakrise besonders klein ist. Viele Fischarten ziehen aufgrund der hohen Wassertemperaturen von den Küsten weit hinaus aufs Meer oder in die Tiefe und sind damit für die hier so wichtige Kleinfischerei unerreichbar. Weniger Fisch bedeutet weniger Nahrung und Einkommen für die Menschen, die vom ­Fischfang leben. Dazu gehören vor allem die Kleinfischer, deren Arbeit die Hälfte der weltweiten ­Fischproduktion ausmacht.



Die Überfischung gilt neben der Klimaerwärmung als größter Stress für die Gesundheit der Meere. Weltweit wird mehr Fisch gefangen als natürlich nachwächst. Nach Angaben der Welternährungsorganisation sind über ein Drittel aller Fischbestände überfischt, rund 60 Prozent werden maximal genutzt. Das bedeutet: Mehr Fischerei ist hier nicht möglich – ein Problem für die wachsende Weltbevölkerung. Überfischung gefährdet nicht nur die Ernährungsgrundlage vieler Menschen, sondern auch massiv die biologische Vielfalt und Widerstandskraft der Ökosysteme. Fehlendes Management und die laxe Überwachung der Meere lassen zusätzlichen Druck durch illegale, ungemeldete und unregulierte Fischerei zu. Der weltweite Fang aus illegaler Fischerei beträgt Schätzungen zufolge bis zu 26 Millionen Tonnen Fisch pro Jahr, das sind rund 30 Prozent des jährlichen legalen Fischfangs.



Darüber hinaus bedrohen Verschmutzung durch Plastikmüll, Öl, Chemikalien oder Nährstoffen aus der Landwirtschaft sowie die fortschreitende Zerstörung von Lebensräumen durch nicht nachhaltige Nutzung in Korallenriffen, Flachmeeren, offenen Ozeanen und an den Küsten die Bestände von Meerestieren und die Funktionsfähigkeit der marinen Ökosysteme.



Alles hängt mit allem zusammen. Das gilt in besonderem Maße für die Weltmeere. Wir brauchen Lösungsansätze auf breiter Front, um den genannten Krisen zu begegnen: ambitionierten politischen Willen, der den Naturschutz auch finanziell befähigt, eine Transformation der produzierenden Industrie hin zu mehr Nachhaltigkeit und maßvollerem Konsum. Mit dem Entwicklungsziel 14 der Agenda 2030 hat sich die Weltgemeinschaft vorgenommen, die Ozeane nachhaltig zu nutzen und zu erhalten. Zehn Unterziele benennen die drängendsten Probleme wie Meeresverschmutzung, Überfischung und Lebensraumzerstörung.



Folgende sechs Hebel sind besonders wichtig, um verbindliche Schutzvorkehrungen durchzusetzen:

Das Klimaabkommen von Paris legt die Begrenzung der Klimaerhitzung auf deutlich unter 2°C gegenüber dem vorindustriellen Zeitalter fest. Dieses Ziel ist elementar für die Gesundheit der Meere.

Die Konvention zum Erhalt der biologischen Vielfalt (CBD) soll die für uns Menschen lebenswichtigen Ökosysteme bewahren und das Aussterben bedrohter Arten verhindern. Im ­chinesischen Kunming soll noch 2022 ein Abkommen verhandelt werden, das die Konvention endlich umsetzen soll, denn bislang verfehlen die Verhandlungen das Ziel, den Naturverlust bis 2030 umzukehren.

Seit zwei Jahrzehnten ringen die Mitgliedstaaten der Welthandelsorganisation (WTO) um ein Abkommen zur Abschaffung schädlicher Fischereisubventionen. Massive wirtschaftliche Interessen erschweren die Verhandlungen. Fischereisubventionen sind ein wesentlicher Treiber für die Überfischung, weltweit stellen Regierungen jedes Jahr geschätzte 22 Milliarden Dollar dafür bereit. Die größten Budgets kommen dabei aus China, Japan, der Europäischen Union und den Vereinigten Staaten. Mit rund 7,2 Milliarden Dollar fließt ein Drittel der Subventionen direkt an industrielle, hochseetaugliche Fangflotten, die häufig in den internationalen Meeresgebieten der Hohen See unterwegs sind, wo Fischerei besonders schwierig zu regulieren und zu kontrollieren ist. Oder die treibstoffsubventionierten Fangexpeditionen führen vor die Küsten von Ländern, denen die Mittel für die Fischereiüberwachung fehlen und wo, wie im Falle von Westafrika, insbesondere Kleinfischer unter den schrumpfenden Fischbeständen leiden. Auf Kosten von Zugangs-, Verteilungs- und Marktgerechtigkeit werden vielfach Fangrechte an Industrieländer verkauft, auch die EU ist daran beteiligt.

Der Abkommensentwurf sieht Sonderregelungen und Übergangsfristen vor, die es auch Entwicklungsländern ermöglichen sollen, zukunftsfähige Fischerei­strukturen aufzubauen. Etwa 90 Prozent der Fischer weltweit stammen aus Entwicklungsländern. Dass allerdings China als das Land mit der weltweit größten Fischereiflotte und mit Abstand größter Subventionsgeber in der WTO als Entwicklungsland behandelt wird, stößt auf Widerstand.

Der Abkommensentwurf sieht Sonderregelungen und Übergangsfristen vor, die es auch Entwicklungsländern ermöglichen sollen, zukunftsfähige Fischerei­strukturen aufzubauen. Etwa 90 Prozent der Fischer weltweit stammen aus Entwicklungsländern. Dass allerdings China als das Land mit der weltweit größten Fischereiflotte und mit Abstand größter Subventionsgeber in der WTO als Entwicklungsland behandelt wird, stößt auf Widerstand. Ebenfalls seit Jahrzehnten wird über das UN-Abkommen zum Schutz der Hohen See verhandelt. Hier stehen den Nutzungsinteressen aus Fischerei, Rohstoffabbau und Schifffahrt kaum Schutzstatuten gegenüber. Eines der Hauptziele ist die Einrichtung von Schutzgebieten, ohne die die Bestrebungen, bis 2030 ein Drittel der Meeresfläche unter Schutz zu stellen, scheitern werden. Mehr als 50 Länder haben sich verpflichtet, den Vertrag noch in diesem Jahr abzuschließen.

Der Tiefseebergbau ist ein weiteres wichtiges Thema. Im UN-Seerechtsübereinkommen sind der Tiefseeboden und seine Ressourcen als gemeinsames Erbe der Menschheit definiert. Die Regulierung obliegt der Internationalen Meeresbodenbehörde. Die Tiefsee ist auf der weltweiten Suche nach neuen Rohstoffquellen ins Visier von Staaten und Unternehmen geraten. Dabei sind die Folgen und Gefahren einer etwaigen industriellen Rohstoffgewinnung nur unvollständig abschätzbar. Wissenschaft, Zivilgesellschaft, Unternehmen und einzelne Staaten fordern deshalb ein Moratorium für Tiefsee­bergbau.

Die Reihe der hier als notwendig beschriebenen Abkommen soll mit einem Vorzeigebeispiel enden: Auf der Umweltversammlung der Vereinten Nationen (UNEA) in Nairobi beschlossen die Mitgliedstaaten im März 2022 einstimmig, die globale Plastik­krise zu lösen. Bis 2024 wird nun ein weltweit verbindlicher Vertrag ausgearbeitet, der die Plastikverschmutzung beenden soll.

Europäische Versäumnisse

In einem Sonderbericht kritisiert der Europäische Rechnungshof im Jahr 2020 die EU für ihre Versäumnisse im Meeresschutz. Selbstgesteckte Ziele wie der „gute Umweltzustand“ in den EU-Meeren oder das Ende der Überfischung blieben uneingelöst. Europas Meere gehören nach wie vor zu den am stärksten überfischten Regionen der Welt. Währenddessen importiert Europa knapp ein Fünftel des weltweit gehandelten Fisches. Der Zustand der Fischbestände in Europas Gewässern muss sich also deutlich verbessern, damit die Import­abhängigkeit des europäischen Marktes verringert werden kann.



Noch immer sind Fangmengen zu hoch, besonders im Mittelmeer, Schutzgebiete stellen keine Tabuzonen für die Fischerei dar, und mit Grundschleppnetzen wird der Meeresboden zerstört. Der Großteil der europäischen Meeresschutzgebiete sind nicht viel mehr als „Paper Parks“, deren Schutzwirkung nur auf dem Papier besteht.



Neben wirksamen Verboten schädlicher Nutzungen in den Schutzgebieten bräuchte es Fangquoten, die den wissenschaftlichen Empfehlungen entsprechen, zielgerichtete Fischereikontrollen, um das latent große Problem der unerwünschten Beifänge und Rückwürfe einzudämmen, sowie ein Verbot zerstörerischer Fischerei­praktiken. Bislang scheitert die Europäische Union aber schon daran, ihre eigenen Fischereigesetze zu kontrollieren.

Das Plastikabkommen zeigt: Hat das Meer politische Priorität, sind Meilensteine erreichbar. So schufen die Initiativen einzelner Länder mit großen Meeresflächen wie die USA, Mexiko oder Neuseeland bedeutsame Schutzgebiete. Auf internationalem Parkett konnte 2016 nach über fünfjährigen Verhandlungen mit 24 Staaten und der EU das antarktische Rossmeer als das derzeit größte Meeresschutzgebiet der Welt ausgewiesen werden. Hoffnung macht auch die Ankündigung von Ecuador, Kolumbien, Costa Rica und Panama, bestehende Schutzgebiete zu verbinden und auszuweiten.



Es geht ums Überleben

Insgesamt findet der Schutz der Meere immer mehr Aufmerksamkeit. Doch öffentliche Versprechen sind leicht gemacht. Geht es um ihre Einlösung und Finanzierung, beginnen die harten Verhandlungen. Der Druck wächst stetig; wenn keine Kehrtwende in der internationalen Meeresschutzpolitik gelingt, wird sich der Zustand verschärfen und zu steigendem Meeresspiegel, Korallensterben, zunehmenden Naturkatastrophen und zum Zusammenbruch mariner Nahrungsnetze führen. Wir brauchen jetzt den Kurswechsel für wirksamen Meeresschutz, vor allem durch effektive Meeresschutzgebiete, begrenzte und nachhaltige Fischerei und eine erfolgreiche Begrenzung der Klima­erhitzung auf unter 1,5 Grad. Das gelingt nur mit starkem politischem Willen, der Reformierung der Wirtschaft und einer engagierten Zivilgesellschaft.



Die UN-Dekade strebt an, im Jahr 2030 sieben Ziele zu erreichen, wie der Ozean aussehen soll: sauber, gesund und widerstandsfähig, produktiv, berechenbar, sicher, zugänglich und inspirierend.

Fünf Tage lang standen die Weltmeere, ihr Zustand und ihr Schutz im Mittelpunkt einer Konferenz in Lissabon. In der Abschlusserklärung wird ""kollektives Versagen"" benannt und mehr Ehrgeiz bei der Suche nach Lösungen gefordert.

Von Reinhard Spiegelhauer, ARD-Studio Madrid

Am Anfang waren starke Worte: UN-Generalsekretär Antonio Guterres sprach von einem Notstand der Meere, menschengemachten Problemen, und davon, dass die Menschheit die Pflicht habe, die Probleme wieder zu lösen. Und der Klimabotschafter und ehemalige Außenminister der USA, John Kerry, warnte: ""Wenn wir keine Antworten finden, bleibt dies alles Rhetorik, diese Treffen landen auf dem Müllhaufen der Geschichte, weil folgende Generationen uns fragen werden: 'Was zum Teufel hast du getan? Warum hast du es nicht getan? Hast du die Arbeit erledigt?'""

HR Logo Reinhard Spiegelhauer ARD-Studio Madrid

Schon vor der Konferenz hat es klare Ziele gegeben: Bis 2030 sollen 30 Prozent der Meere unter Schutz stehen, Meeres- und Küstenökosysteme geschützt, die Fischereiwirtschaft nachhaltiger werden.

Manuel Barange, der Chef der Abteilung Fischerei und Aquakultur bei der Welternährungsorganisation, meldete auch Fortschritte: ""Der Anteil von Aquakulturen wächst auf allen Kontinenten. Dabei sinkt der Anteil, der nicht für den direkten menschlichen Verzehr gedacht ist, wodurch die Produktion von Nahrung effizienter geworden ist - das ist schon eine blaue Transformation.""

Verbot von Tiefseebergbau

Ein Hauptanliegen vieler NGOs ist ein umfassendes Verbot von Tiefseebergbau. Internationale Großkonzerne hatten das bei der ersten Ozeankonferenz in New York vor fünf Jahren zurückgewiesen. Es geht um wertvolle Rohstoffe wie Mangan, Nickel, Kupfer und seltene Erden.

Sean Owen von der Umweltschutzorganisation Deepsea Conservation argumentiert für ein vorbeugendes Verbot: ""Noch gibt es keinen Unterwasserbergbau, aber er stellt ein enormes Risiko für die Ozeane dar. Er würde noch verschlimmern, was wir schon angerichtet haben: Meeresverschmutzung, Überfischung und Klimawandel. Das ist eine Grenze, die wir nicht überschreiten sollten. Wir müssen unsere Ozeane schützen und dafür sorgen, dass sie sich erholen.""

Gerade da gebe es positive Impulse, sagte die deutsche Umweltministerin Steffi Lemke in Lissabon: Frankreichs Präsident Emmanuel Macron hatte bei seinem Auftritt Gesetze gegen Tiefseebergbau gefordert, das sei ein starkes Statement. Sie selbst habe daran mitgewirkt, dass die G7 schon große Hürden für Tiefseebergbau vereinbart hätten.

Umweltschützer: Eine vertane Chance

Umweltorganisationen sehen die Ozeankonferenz in Lissabon trotzdem als vertane Chance: Die verabschiedete ""Erklärung von Lissabon"" sei unverbindlich. Es sei völlig unklar,ob angekündigte freiwillige Maßnahmen auch umgesetzt würden. In die gleiche Kerbe schlägt Greenpeace.

Die Vereinten Nationen müssten endlich ein bindendes Abkommen verabschieden, sagte Laura Meller von der Organisation: ""Ein starkes globales Meeresabkommen, das es uns ermöglicht, ein Netzwerk von Meeresschutzgebieten zu schaffen, um bis 2030 mindestens ein Drittel der Weltmeere zu schützen. Im August in New York bei den Vereinten Nationen schlägt die Stunde der Wahrheit.""",de,"Madrid, USA, Frankreichs, New York, Tiefseebergbau, Lissabon","ARD-Studio, Aquakulturen, Nickel, Organisation, Meere, NGOs, Schutz, Deepsea Conservation, Greenpeace, Erden, ARD-Studio Madrid, Kupfer, UN, Mangan, G7, Meeresschutz","Antonio Guterres, Laura Meller, Sean Owen, Von Spiegelhauer, Steffi Lemke, Reinhard Spiegelhauer, John Kerry, Emmanuel Macron, Manuel Barange","ein, lissabon, es, tiefseebergbau, konferenz, ozeankonferenz, verbot, kollektives, meeresschutz, weltmeere"

Insulaner kommen in einem Film zu Wort. Wo es diesen zu sehen gibt.

Viele Sylter haben eine besondere Beziehung zu der Nordsee. Darüber sprechen sie nun in einem Film (Archivfoto).

Sylt. Klimawandel, Verschmutzung und Überfischung – die Weltmeere leiden und letztendlich wird es auch der Mensch – darin sind sich Forscher sicher. Um dieser Entwicklung entgegen zu wirken und die Ozeane widerstandsfähiger zu machen, haben die Vereinten Nationen eine Dekade der Meeresforschung für nachhaltige Entwicklung ausgerufen. Daran beteiligt sich auch Sylt mit einem Videoprojekt.

Vom 9. bis zum 11. März gibt es virtuell zahlreiche Beiträge von internationalen Forscher und Meeresschützern. In diesem Rahmen wird der auf der Nordseeinsel entstandene Film ""Magisches Meer – Sylt engagiert sich!"" gezeigt.

Sylt zeigt, welchen Beitrag es zum Schutz der Ozeane leistet

Wie der Titel verrät, kommen in diesem Videoprojekt die Insulaner zu Wort. Sie waren aufgerufen, Videos einzuschicken, in denen sie beispielsweise ihre Beziehung zum Meer schildern oder zeigen, wie sie sich für den Schutz dieses Lebensraums einsetzen.

""In diesem Gemeinschaftsprojekt soll die Vielfalt des Sylter Engagements für den Meeresschutz gezeigt und gleichzeitig die Bedeutung der Meere für den Planeten in den Mittelpunkt gestellt werden"", heißt es vom Insel Sylt Tourismus Service (ISTS). Gemeinsam mit der Sylt Marketing GmbH, dem Erlebniszentrum Naturgewalten Sylt, der Schutzstation Wattenmeer und der Initiative „Merret reicht’s – aus Liebe zu Sylt“ ist dieses Videoprojekt entstanden.

Liebe zur Nordsee soll Welle der Solidarität auslösen

Neben einem Seehundjäger, einer Surferin, Strandreinigern oder einer Wissenschaftlerin des Alfred Wegener Instituts in List auf Sylt kommen viele andere Akteure in dem Film zu Wort. Laut ISTS ist das Ergebnis des Videoprojekts ein leidenschaftliches und emotionales Plädoyer für den Ozean, das andere mitreißt und ebenfalls begeistert, das Meer zu schützen. Ziel sei es, durch die Liebe der Beteiligten für die Nordsee eine Welle der Solidarität für unsere Meere auszulösen.

Gezeigt wird der Film ""Magisches Meer – Sylt engagiert sich!"" am Freitag, 11. März, ab 16.20 Uhr auf der Internetseite Ocean Decade Conference. Wer den Film sehen möchte, muss sich zuvor auf der Internetseite registrieren.

Ein weiterer Baustein der Clean Oceans Initiative: Meeresschutz und Erhalt der einzigartigen Biodiversität in der Karibik - KfW unterstützt Verringerung des Plastikmülls

Frankfurt am Main (ots)

25,7 Mio. EUR für die Etablierung einer nachhaltigen Kreislaufwirtschaft

Schutz der Heimat von mehr als 12.000 Arten sowie von Korallenriffen und Mangrovenwäldern

Beitrag zur Sicherung der Lebensgrundlage und der Gesundheit von 20.000 Menschen durch Verbesserung der Einkommens- und Ernährungssituation

Die KfW hat heute im Auftrag des Bundesministeriums für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ) mit der regionalen Umweltstiftung Caribbean Biodiversity Fund (CBF) einen Vertrag für die Einrichtung der Circular Economy-Fazilität zur Förderung der Kreislaufwirtschaft in der Karibik unterzeichnet. Die Fazilität erhält 25,7 Mio. EUR und wird mindestens 18 Vorhaben finanzieren, die mit Hilfe von kreislaufwirtschaftlichen Prinzipien zur Vermeidung und Entfernung des Plastikmülls beitragen. Durch die geplanten Maßnahmen wird die Zerstörung des Hotspots der Biodiversität in der Karibik mit mehr als 12.000 Arten gebremst, denn die Verschmutzung des karibischen Meers ist auch Ursache für das Arten- und Korallenriffsterben.

""Die Karibik ist nach dem Mittelmeer das am stärksten verschmutzte Meer weltweit und gleichzeitig ein globaler Biodiversitätshotspot. Durch die mit der ungehinderten Einleitung von derzeit jährlich bis zu 300.000 Tonnen Abfall ins Meer verbundene Verschmutzung werden die marinen Ökosysteme immer stärker bedroht, Arten verschwinden und es kommt zu sinkenden Einkommen der lokalen Bevölkerung, die stark vom Tourismus und der Fischerei lebt. Ein gesundes Ökosystem ist die Lebensgrundlage der karibischen Bevölkerung und muss erhalten werden,"" sagte Christiane Laibach, Mitglied des Vorstandes der KfW Bankengruppe.

Die neue Fazilität soll insbesondere zu einer Reduktion der Feststoffabfälle in ausgewählten Gebieten des karibischen Meeres führen. Konkret geht es um die Verlängerung des Lebenszyklus von Produkten, die schrittweise Abschaffung von Einwegverpackungen, das Recycling von Abfallprodukten und die Entfernung von Müll aus Wasserwegen. Es wird erwartet, dass mindestens 20.000 Personen direkt von den Maßnahmen profitieren. Darüber hinaus nützt eine saubere Karibik allen 43 Millionen Einwohnern der Region.

Zu den Maßnahmen der Fazilität gehören auch die Förderung von Forschung und Entwicklung, der Erfahrungsaustausch zwischen relevanten Akteuren der verschiedenen Inselentwicklungsstaaten sowie die Sensibilisierung der Bevölkerung. Teilnahmeberechtigte Antragsteller der Fazilität sind Nichtregierungsorganisationen, Universitäten, öffentliche Institutionen, zivilgesellschaftliche Institutionen und der Privatsektor. Das Projekt erstreckt sich über folgende Länder und Territorien der Karibik: Dominika, Dominikanische Republik, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaika, Kuba, Montserrat, St. Lucia, St. Vincent und die Grenadinen.

Beim CBF handelt es sich um einen regionalen Umweltkapitalfonds, der 2012 mit Unterstützung der KfW zur Finanzierung von Maßnahmen des Umweltschutzes in der Karibik gegründet wurde und im September 2022 sein zehnjähriges Bestehen feierte.

Das Projekt ist Teil der Clean Oceans Initiative (COI). Dabei handelt es sich um eine gemeinsame Initiative europäischer Entwicklungsbanken zur Finanzierung von Projekten, um den Eintrag von Plastikmüll in die Meere zu reduzieren. Seit Ende 2018 hat die Initiative bereits Finanzierungen in Höhe von rund 1,9 Mrd. EUR für Projekte des öffentlichen und privaten Sektors bereitgestellt, die die Einleitung von Plastik, Mikroplastik und anderen Abfällen in die Meere durch besseres Abfall-, Abwasser- und Niederschlagsmanagement verringern. Das Ziel der COI Partnerbanken ist bis 2025 4 Mrd. EUR zu erreichen.

Measures to mitigate the stress or failure of flood protection systems

Floods can occur along all watercourses and, in extreme cases, overwhelm flood protection systems. Flood protection systems can be adapted by reinforcing or constructing new technical flood protection systems. These are mainly dams, dikes, reservoirs, flood retention basins, polders, weirs, local flood protection walls or mobile walls.

In addition to technical measures, measures that serve to create retention areas to hold back water in the area and to restore near-natural watercourse structures are also of great importance. For example, meandering rivers and streams reduce the flow velocity and thus reduce the peak discharge of floods. Floodplains, floodplains and oxbows connected to the watercourse can absorb part of the flood runoff.

In addition, measures for behavioural and structural precautions, for improving flood forecasting, for crisis management and for risk-adapted reconstruction help to prevent damage.

By the end of 2015, nationally and internationally coordinated flood risk management plans were drawn up for all German river basins for the first time. They must be reviewed and updated every six years. For this purpose, hazard and risk maps are drawn up and updated for areas at risk, objectives for dealing with existing risks are formulated and action plans for achieving the objectives are drawn up and further developed.

Measures to reduce water body temperature and improve biological water quality

High water temperatures can lead to eutrophication of a water body. To prevent this, it is important to reduce nutrient inputs into the water body. This requires measures that help to reduce fertiliser quantities as well as soil erosion and runoff, minimise nutrient inputs by establishing water protection strips, or drain agricultural soils in a more environmentally friendly way. Land-based animal husbandry also contributes to the protection of water bodies from eutrophication. Especially in small and medium-sized water bodies, shading by riparian vegetation can also help to prevent the water from warming up too much.

Indicator from the monitoring on the DAS: Riparian vegetation of small, medium-sized water bodies-case study

Groundwater level and groundwater quality

Adaptation measures to declining groundwater levels aim to strike a balance between abstraction and recharge. Groundwater abstraction can be reduced by implementing measures that reduce drinking water consumption. Starting points are, for example, the sprinkling of agricultural areas or the increased use of greywater or rainwater wherever the type of use allows. Groundwater consumption can also be reduced through higher water extraction fees for water-using industries with high environmental impacts, such as agriculture and mining, as well as increased savings incentives for private consumers.

In addition, there are various groundwater recharge strategies, for example through the planned infiltration of additional water volumes. Groundwater recharge can also be promoted through the conversion of coniferous to deciduous forests.

To improve groundwater quality, it is necessary to reduce contamination by nitrate from agricultural sources.",en,,,,"water, flood, protection, measures, groundwater, management, systems, risk, addition, areas"

„Wir müssen viel mehr tun, wir alle“: UN-Generalsekretär António Guterres in Lissabon. © Armando Franca/AP/dpa

Es geht um nicht weniger als um die Rettung der Weltmeere. In Lissabon treffen sich Politiker, Forscher, Aktivisten und Stars zur UN-Ozeankonferenz. Schon zu Beginn wird klar: Es geht um viel.

Lissabon/Berlin - „Leute, wir brauchen Veränderung!“, ruft Hollywoodstar Jason Momoa (42/„Aquaman“) aus Hawaii ins Publikum - und UN-Generalsekretär António Guterres spricht von einem „Notstand“.

Die zweite Ozeankonferenz der Vereinten Nationen begann am Montag in Lissabon mit emotionalen Appellen und eindringlichen Forderungen zur Rettung der von Vermüllung, Überfischung, Klimawandel und Versauerung zunehmend in Mitleidenschaft gezogenen Weltmeere.

Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke fliegt erst am Mittwochabend in die portugiesische Hauptstadt. Worum es in erster Linie geht, machte sie aber bereits am Montag in einer Ministeriums-Mitteilung zur fünftägigen Tagung klar: Gesunde Meere seien „für uns Menschen überlebenswichtig“. „Deshalb müssen wir vom Reden ins Handeln kommen und dem Meeresschutz viel höhere Priorität einräumen.“

Knapp 30 Staats- und Regierungschefs, weitere Politiker sowie Wissenschaftler, zum Teil sehr junge Aktivisten und Vertreter von Nichtregierungsorganisationen und Unternehmen werden bis Freitag darüber diskutieren, wie die Ressourcen der Weltmeere besser geschützt und möglichst nachhaltig genutzt werden können.

Am Abend demonstrierten hunderte Demonstranten, darunter viele Deutsche, am Rande der zweiten UN-Ozeankonferenz in Lissabon für einen besseren Schutz der Weltmeere. In der portugiesischen Hauptstadt riefen sie Parolen wie „Die Politiker reden, die Ozeane sterben“ oder „Hört auf die Wissenschaft, Klimarevolution sofort!“. Die Polizei sprach von mindestens 500 Teilnehmern.

Lemke: Gefährden unsere eigenen Lebensgrundlagen

„Wenn wir das Zerstören der Meere nicht beenden, gefährden wir nicht nur wunderbare Naturschätze, sondern auch unsere eigenen Lebensgrundlagen. Meeresschutz hilft uns im Kampf gegen die Klimakrise, die Verschmutzungskrise und das Artenaussterben“, sagte Lemke. Die Grünen-Politikerin meint, man müsse „übergreifender denken und den Schutz der Meere und Ozeane sowie die natur- und umweltverträgliche Nutzung miteinander in Einklang bringen“.

Die Ministerin betonte, dass Deutschland zur Stärkung des Schutzes der Meere eine nationale Strategie erarbeite: „Eine eigene Unterabteilung Meeresschutz innerhalb des Ministeriums befindet sich gerade im Aufbau.“ Zudem werde noch in diesem Sommer der erste Meeresbeauftragte der Bundesregierung seine Arbeit aufnehmen.

Guterres fordert „drastische Maßnahmen“

Aber nationale Initiativen sowie die Fortschritte der letzten Jahre seien bei weitem nicht genug, warnte Guterres. „Wir müssen viel mehr tun, wir alle.“ Er rief zu weltweiten Anstrengungen auf und forderte „drastische Maßnahmen“ vor allem zur Bekämpfung der Meeresverschmutzung mit Kunststoffen. Die größte Plastikinsel im Pazifik sei bereits so groß wie Frankreich, Plastikteilchen seien inzwischen in entlegensten Ecken zu finden. 2021 seien beim Anstieg des Meeresspiegels, der Erwärmung und der Versauerung der Meere und bei Treibhausgaskonzentrationen neue Rekordwerte erreicht worden.

Wie Lemke forderte auch die Umweltschutzorganisation WWF anlässlich des Auftakts der UN-Konferenz „Taten“ anstelle von „Ankündigungen und Versprechungen“. Heike Vesper, Leiterin Meeresschutz bei WWF Deutschland, sagte, die Weltgemeinschaft müsse „einen konsequenten politischen Kurswechsel zugunsten der Meere vollziehen“. Nach Ansicht des WWF muss die Konferenz „vor allem bei den laufenden Verhandlungen zum Abkommen über den Schutz der Hohen See und der Unterschutzstellung von 30 Prozent der Meeresfläche bis 2030 sowie für ein Moratorium für Tiefseebergbau Fortschritte bringen“.

Keine bindenden Vereinbarungen geplant

Am Freitag soll eine „Erklärung von Lissabon“ mit „innovativen, wissenschaftlich fundierten Lösungsvorschlägen“ veröffentlicht werden. Umweltschützer äußerten sich derweil skeptisch, weil keine bindenden Vereinbarungen getroffen werden sollen.

Nach der ersten Tagung 2017 in New York findet die zweite Ozeankonferenz wegen Corona mit zweijähriger Verspätung statt. Neben Guterres und Lemke nehmen an der Versammlung nach amtlichen Angaben unter anderem Ex-US-Außenminister John Kerry und Frankreichs Präsident Emmanuel Macron teil. Auch der britische Premier Boris Johnson wolle möglicherweise vorbeischauen. Sportstars wie die weltbeste Riesenwellen-Surferin Maya Gabeira sind auch mit dabei. Ungeachtet des russischen Angriffskriegs haben sich zudem sowohl Vertreter Russlands als auch der Ukraine angesagt.

Die Weltmeere bedecken mehr als 70 Prozent der Erdoberfläche und beherbergen über 80 Prozent des Lebens auf der Erde. Für Milliarden Menschen sind sie Arbeits- und Ernährungsgrundlage. Die Ozeane sind außerdem ein entscheidender Bestandteil des globalen Klimasystems. dpa",de,"Einklang, Hauptstadt, Frankreich, Deutschland, Ukraine, Russlands, Beginn, Hawaii, Frankreichs, New York, Berlin, Lissabon","dpa, Polizei, AP/dpa, Ex-US-Außenminister, Meere, Ozeane, Klimakrise, Weltmeere, Riesenwellen-Surferin, WWF Deutschland, WWF, UN, Klimasystems","António Guterres, Armando Franca, Maya Gabeira, Steffi Lemke, Heike Vesper, Boris Johnson, John Kerry, Emmanuel Macron, Jason Momoa","ozeankonferenz, meeresschutz, lissabon, meere, un, guterres, weltmeere, viel, lemke, hunderte"

Sehr geehrte Barbara Pompili,

sehr geehrter Dy Ould Zein,

sehr geehrte Kolleginnen und Kollegen,

meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren,

wir alle sind auf gesunde Meere angewiesen. Meere sind ein wichtiger CO 2 -Speicher und sie regulieren das Klima. Sie sind Lebensraum einer einzigartigen Flora und Fauna, Verbindung zwischen Ländern und Kontinenten, Nahrungsquelle und Energielieferant.

Zur Realität gehören aber auch Überfischung, Verschmutzung und gigantische Plastikmüll-Strudel. Vieles von dem, was wir Menschen tun, gefährdet die natürlichen Funktionen der Meere. Rasches und entschlossenes Handeln ist nötig, damit diese einzigartige Lebens-Quelle nicht unwiederbringlich zerstört wird.

Der Meeresschutz wird deswegen für mich und für die gesamte Bundesregierung in den nächsten Jahren ein Thema von herausragender Bedeutung sein.

Ich werde eine Offensive für den Meeresschutz starten, die alle Facetten des Meeresschutzes zusammenführt, um Schutz und umweltverträgliche Nutzung der Meere miteinander in Einklang zu bringen. Hierzu erarbeitet das Umweltministerium eine verbindliche und ressortübergreifende Meeresstrategie. Ein besonders sichtbares Zeichen wird künftig die Koordination der Meerespolitik unter Leitung eeines Meeresbeauftragten sein.

Zur Meeresoffensive gehört eine ambitionierte internationale Ozeanpolitik. Globale Krisen wie das Artenaussterben oder die Verschmutzung der Meere lassen sich nur im Konzert der Staatengemeinschaft lösen.

Drei Handlungsfelder möchte ich hervorheben:

Erstens: Deutschland arbeitet mit seinen Partnern an einem zügigen Abschluss der UN-Verhandlungen für ein Übereinkommen zum Schutz der Biodiversität und der nachhaltigen Nutzung der Hohen See. Wir müssen uns gemeinsam weiter für neue Meeresschutzgebiete im Südpolarmeer einsetzen, insbesondere im Weddellmeer und in der Ostantarktis. Dort befinden sich die letzten weitgehend unberührten Meeresgebiete, die ein unersetzlicher Lebensraum für viele marine Arten sind.

Zweitens ist mir wichtig, dass die Verhandlungen über ein rechtsverbindliches UN-Abkommen gegen Meeresmüll und Plastikverschmutzung zügig beginnen. Das Ergebnis muss dann umfassend und definitiv das Ende der Meeresvermüllung besiegeln. Dafür werde ich mich bei der UNEA-Sitzung Ende Februar einsetzen. Deutschland wird auch seine G7-Präsidentschaft nutzen, um den globalen Meeresschutz voranzubringen.

Drittens gibt es auch vor unserer Haustür viel zu tun: bei der Umsetzung der europäischen und regionalen Ziele im Meeresschutz. Die EU-Biodiversitätsstrategie verlangt, dass bis 2030 30 Prozent der Meeresfläche Europas unter Schutz gestellt werden. Dabei ist zentral, dass die EU-Meeresschutzgebiete echte Rückzugsorte für die marine Flora und Fauna sind.

Das wird nur gelingen, wenn schädliche Nutzungen eingeschränkt werden. In Deutschland sind gerade die Managementpläne für die Schutzgebiete in der Ostsee in Kraft getreten. Damit können nun konkrete Maßnahmen starten – zum Beispiel für weniger Unterwasserlärm, zur Wiederherstellung von Riffen, für naturverträglichere Fischfangmethoden und saubereres Wasser. Damit stehen jetzt über 30 Prozent der deutschen AWZ von Nord- und Ostsee unter Schutz.

Ich will verstärkt auf naturbasierte Lösungen setzen – nicht nur, aber auch im Meer – weil sie eine Hebelwirkung für den Biodiversitäts- und Klimaschutz entfalten können. Deshalb werde ich ein Programm für Kohlenstoff speichernde Ökosysteme im Meer auf den Weg bringen und zum Beispiel Seegraswiesen und Algenwälder fördern. So bekommen Meeresbewohner und ihr Lebensraum eine Chance, sich zu erholen und gleichzeitig die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels besser abzufedern.

Ich wünsche mir, dass 2022 das Jahr wird, in dem der Meeresschutz auf allen Ebenen vorankommt – national, in Europa und weltweit. Frankreich hat mit dieser Konferenz ein großartiges Forum für den Meeresschutz geschaffen. Dafür bedanke ich mich und freue mich darauf, gemeinsam mit unserem Partner Frankreich und Ihnen allen die vielfältigen Aufgaben in Angriff zu nehmen.

Nach einer Rettung von einem Seehund stand zunächst die für Meeressäuger fachkundige Tierärztin wegen Jagdwilderei vor Gericht, da das Robben-Retten illegal sei. Auch gegen die beiden Helfer, die unter Anleitung der Tierärztin geholfen hatten, wurde ein Verfahren angestrengt. Einer der Helfer ist André van Gemmert, der 1976 sein Wildlife-Management-Studium in Gießen und Amsterdam absolvierte und seitdem weltweit im Einsatz für Robben und Seehunde in Not war und noch heute ein international gefragter Ansprechpartner für die Meeressäuger ist. Seehunde fallen unter das Jagdrecht, obwohl diese seit Jahrzehnten nicht mehr gejagt werden dürfen. Die Entscheidung über Leben und Tod über einen in Not geratenen Seehund, treffen ohne medizinische Untersuchungen und ohne veterinärmedizinische Ausbildung Seehundjäger:innen, welche der Hobbyjagd nachgehen. Tierärzte und in diesem Fall eine Tierärztin mit ihren Helfern vom Robbenzentrum Föhr mit jahrzehntelanger Erfahrung mit den Meeressäugern werden von Jägern immer wieder angezeigt und vor Gericht gezerrt, wenn sie Tieren in Not helfen. Die angezeigte Tierärztin betreibt und gründete 2010 mit André van Gemmert das gemeinnützige Robbenzentrum auf der Insel Föhr, welches seither rund um die Uhr und an 365 Tagen einsatzbereit ist, um in Not geratenen Meeressäugern zu helfen. Die Tierschützer vom Robbenzentrum Föhr konnten in den letzten 12 Jahren schon hunderten Seehunden das Leben retten. Aber was ist der Beweggrund dann Tierärzte anzuzeigen, welche in Not geratenen Tieren helfen, was auch deren Beruf und Berufung ist? Die nachfolgenden Fakten lassen die Vermutung zu, dass es um finanzielle Interessen geht. Im Jahr 2019 wurden an den Küsten und auf den Inseln allein auf Sylt 690 Tiere erschossen, was Aufwandsentschädigungen von mehr als 31.000 Euro generierte, die sich einige wenige Hobbyjäger:innen dazuverdienen. Andere vernünftige Gründe, als der Verlust von den „Schussprämien“ lassen sich keine finden, dass die Tierärztin und ihre Helfer schon mehrfach angezeigt wurden und bei Einsätzen bedrängt und angefeindet werden. Daher war es die einzig richtige Entscheidung, dass im Verfahren vom März die Tierärztin freigesprochen wurde und nun auch das Verfahren gegen die beiden Helfer eingestellt wurde. Ein Ende der Gängelei ist nicht in Sicht, da die Seehundjäger / Hobbyjäger sicherlich auch in Zukunft mit Rückendeckung der Jagdlobby wieder Anzeigen erstatten werden und die Tierretter weiterhin unangenehme Begegnungen erwarten müssen. Das gemeinnützige Robbenzentrum Föhr wird weiterhin an 365 Tagen und 24 h einsatzbereit sein, um Robben in Not zu helfen und kämpft weiter, um endlich eine Gesetzesänderung herbeizuführen.

In einer Erklärung im Gorgona-Nationalpark, einer Insel im Süden des kolumbianischen Pazifiks kündigte Präsident Iván Duque am Sonntag, den 23. Januar 2022 an, die ""historischen Atolle und Korallenriffe unseres Landes zu schützen"". Die bestehende Militärstrategie ""Operation Artemis"" zur Bekämpfung von Entwaldung werde damit auf die Ozeane ausgeweitet, zitiert die Nachrichtenagentur EFE Duque.

Die Marine des Landes, das sowohl an den Pazifischen Ozean als auch an das Karibische Meer grenzt, werde sich dafür der Artemisa-Kampagne der Landstreitkräfte anschließen, informiert das kolumbianische Präsidialamt in einer Pressemitteilung. Im Vordergrund des Einsatzes der Seestreitkräfte stehe der Schutz angegriffener Korallenriffe, die Bekämpfung illegaler Schleppnetzfischerei und unkontrolliertem Fischfang, allesamt Bedrohungen für die hohe Biodiversität an und vor Kolumbiens 3.047 Kilometer langen Küsten.

Die Nichtregierungsorganisation ""Ideaspaz"" warnt vor den Risiken einer ""grünen Militarisierung"". In einer 2020 veröffentlichten Studie heißt es, der Repressionsdruck auf Gruppen wie Bauern und andere vulnerable Gruppen werde so weiter zunehmen. Die Artemisa-Kampagne wurde im April 2019 zum Schutz heimischer Nationalparks gestartet. Die Armee bekämpft Entwaldung und illegalen Bergbau und verfolgt die Täter von Umweltverbrechen. In Südamerika belegt Kolumbien Platz 2 der Länder mit der größten Biodiversität. Rund zehn Prozent aller Arten finden sich auf kolumbianischem Staatsgebiet. Wegen der Vielfalt von Arten, Gattungen und Familien und verschiedenen Ökosystemen zählt Kolumbien zu den Ländern mit der höchsten Biodiversität weltweit. (bb)

Luftverteidigung: USA wollen Ukraine Waffensystem liefern

«Leute, wir brauchen Veränderung!», ruft Hollywoodstar Jason Momoa (42/«Aquaman») aus Hawaii ins Publikum - und UN-Generalsekretär António Guterres spricht von einem «Notstand».

Die zweite Ozeankonferenz der Vereinten Nationen begann am Montag in Lissabon mit emotionalen Appellen und eindringlichen Forderungen zur Rettung der von Vermüllung, Überfischung, Klimawandel und Versauerung zunehmend in Mitleidenschaft gezogenen Weltmeere.

Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke fliegt erst am Mittwochabend in die portugiesische Hauptstadt. Worum es in erster Linie geht, machte sie aber bereits am Montag in einer Ministeriums-Mitteilung zur fünftägigen Tagung klar: Gesunde Meere seien «für uns Menschen überlebenswichtig». «Deshalb müssen wir vom Reden ins Handeln kommen und dem Meeresschutz viel höhere Priorität einräumen.»

Knapp 30 Staats- und Regierungschefs, weitere Politiker sowie Wissenschaftler, zum Teil sehr junge Aktivisten und Vertreter von Nichtregierungsorganisationen und Unternehmen werden bis Freitag darüber diskutieren, wie die Ressourcen der Weltmeere besser geschützt und möglichst nachhaltig genutzt werden können.

Am Abend demonstrierten hunderte Demonstranten, darunter viele Deutsche, am Rande der zweiten UN-Ozeankonferenz in Lissabon für einen besseren Schutz der Weltmeere. In der portugiesischen Hauptstadt riefen sie Parolen wie «Die Politiker reden, die Ozeane sterben» oder «Hört auf die Wissenschaft, Klimarevolution sofort!». Die Polizei sprach von mindestens 500 Teilnehmern.

Lemke: Gefährden unsere eigenen Lebensgrundlagen

«Wenn wir das Zerstören der Meere nicht beenden, gefährden wir nicht nur wunderbare Naturschätze, sondern auch unsere eigenen Lebensgrundlagen. Meeresschutz hilft uns im Kampf gegen die Klimakrise, die Verschmutzungskrise und das Artenaussterben», sagte Lemke. Die Grünen-Politikerin meint, man müsse «übergreifender denken und den Schutz der Meere und Ozeane sowie die natur- und umweltverträgliche Nutzung miteinander in Einklang bringen».

Die Ministerin betonte, dass Deutschland zur Stärkung des Schutzes der Meere eine nationale Strategie erarbeite: «Eine eigene Unterabteilung Meeresschutz innerhalb des Ministeriums befindet sich gerade im Aufbau.» Zudem werde noch in diesem Sommer der erste Meeresbeauftragte der Bundesregierung seine Arbeit aufnehmen.

Guterres fordert «drastische Maßnahmen»

Aber nationale Initiativen sowie die Fortschritte der letzten Jahre seien bei weitem nicht genug, warnte Guterres. «Wir müssen viel mehr tun, wir alle.» Er rief zu weltweiten Anstrengungen auf und forderte «drastische Maßnahmen» vor allem zur Bekämpfung der Meeresverschmutzung mit Kunststoffen. Die größte Plastikinsel im Pazifik sei bereits so groß wie Frankreich, Plastikteilchen seien inzwischen in entlegensten Ecken zu finden. 2021 seien beim Anstieg des Meeresspiegels, der Erwärmung und der Versauerung der Meere und bei Treibhausgaskonzentrationen neue Rekordwerte erreicht worden.

Wie Lemke forderte auch die Umweltschutzorganisation WWF anlässlich des Auftakts der UN-Konferenz «Taten» anstelle von «Ankündigungen und Versprechungen». Heike Vesper, Leiterin Meeresschutz bei WWF Deutschland, sagte, die Weltgemeinschaft müsse «einen konsequenten politischen Kurswechsel zugunsten der Meere vollziehen». Nach Ansicht des WWF muss die Konferenz «vor allem bei den laufenden Verhandlungen zum Abkommen über den Schutz der Hohen See und der Unterschutzstellung von 30 Prozent der Meeresfläche bis 2030 sowie für ein Moratorium für Tiefseebergbau Fortschritte bringen».

Keine bindenden Vereinbarungen geplant

Am Freitag soll eine «Erklärung von Lissabon» mit «innovativen, wissenschaftlich fundierten Lösungsvorschlägen» veröffentlicht werden. Umweltschützer äußerten sich derweil skeptisch, weil keine bindenden Vereinbarungen getroffen werden sollen.

Nach der ersten Tagung 2017 in New York findet die zweite Ozeankonferenz wegen Corona mit zweijähriger Verspätung statt. Neben Guterres und Lemke nehmen an der Versammlung nach amtlichen Angaben unter anderem Ex-US-Außenminister John Kerry und Frankreichs Präsident Emmanuel Macron teil. Auch der britische Premier Boris Johnson wolle möglicherweise vorbeischauen. Sportstars wie die weltbeste Riesenwellen-Surferin Maya Gabeira sind auch mit dabei. Ungeachtet des russischen Angriffskriegs haben sich zudem sowohl Vertreter Russlands als auch der Ukraine angesagt.

Sie unterstützen darin den G7 Ocean Deal und bitten die G7-UmweltministerInnen bis Ende des Jahres über die Fortschritte Bericht zu erstatten.

Damit senden die G7-Staaten ein wichtiges Signal Richtung Lissabon, wo sich in dieser Woche auf der Weltozeankonferenz der Vereinten Nationen die internationale Meeres-Community versammelt um gemeinsam einen wirksamen Schutz der Meere und Ozeane voranzubringen.

Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke: „Der Schutz der Meere ist von herausragender Bedeutung im Kampf gegen die Klimakrise, die Verschmutzungskrise und das Artenaussterben. Die G7-Staaten beanspruchen mit der Verabschiedung des Ocean Deal eine Führungsrolle zum Schutz der Meere und müssen nun konkrete Maßnahmen zur Umsetzung dieser Ambitionen folgen lassen. Dafür treten wir auch auf der Weltozeankonferenz in Lissabon an.“

Auf der Weltozeankonferenz der Vereinten Nationen, die vom 27. Juni bis zum 1. Juli in Lissabon stattfindet, wird Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke die Ergebnisse der laufenden G7-Präsidentschaft mit Blick auf den Meeresschutz präsentieren und damit den Anspruch der G7, eine Führungsrolle beim internationalen Meeresschutz einzunehmen, untermauern.

Der Ocean Deal wurde Ende Mai auf Initiative von Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke durch die G7-Umweltminister*innen verabschiedet. Im Ocean Deal haben die G7-Staaten eine erhebliche Ambitionssteigerung verabredet, sich klar zu den wichtigsten laufenden Meeres-Verhandlungsprozessen positioniert und Maßnahmen zur Umsetzung von ambitioniertem Meeresschutz angekündigt.

Hierzu fordern die G7, die Verhandlungen für ein globales Abkommen zum Schutz der Biodiversität auf Hoher See (BBNJ) noch in diesem Jahr zum Abschluss zu bringen. Sie bekennen sich erstmals zu besonders streng geschützten Meeresgebieten und drängen darauf, im Rahmen der Verhandlungen auf der Weltnaturkonferenz in Montreal das Ziel festzuschreiben, 30 Prozent der Meere bis 2030 unter Schutz zu stellen.

Mit Blick auf einen potenziellen Tiefseebergbau betonen die G7 die drohenden dramatischen Auswirkungen für die Meeresumwelt und stärken ihren Einsatz für höchste Umweltstandards bei den Verhandlungen der Meeresbodenbehörde.

The Centre for International Maritime Affairs, Ghana (CIMAG), is calling for the establishment of an integrated ocean governance policy in order to provide a legal and political framework that protect our oceans for a sustainable marine future.

Speaking on Eye on Port following the World Oceans Day Celebrations, Executive Director of CIMAG, Albert Derrick Fiatui, said such a policy will provide the reference point for the necessary coordination from the various governmental agencies who have some mandate to perform on the country’s oceans.

Mr. Fiatui said, “what we see currently is an amorphous management of the ocean by various agencies. The Ghana Maritime Authority is supposed to be the landlord of the ocean, the environmental protection agency, the fisheries commission is doing something, the National Petroleum Authority and the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and even the National Communications Authority because of the fiber-optics they put in the sea. All their activities are not very well coordinated so when issues arise you do not know who to go to.”

He lamented the deplorable state of the oceans in some of Ghana’s coastal areas, when it comes to marine litter.

The Executive Director of CIMAG bemoaned the indiscriminate dumping of all forms of refuse in our waterways, decrying consequences to human and marine life.

“If you go to Nungua, there is a gutter that connect through Regional Maritime University to the sea. You will be shocked to find nose masks, refrigerators, lorry tires and all forms of plastics. The danger is that when they go in the sea, the fish ingest them, and we in turn consume those fishes and they pose a danger to us. The newer diseases, the cancers could be attributed to some of these things.”

He also bemoaned the ongoing use of mangrove resources for domestic and commercial use by some indigenes of coastal communities.

He said a lot of these human activities is borne from ignorance hence the need for increased awareness creation.

Taking her turn on the subject, the Acting Director in charge of Natural Resources at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Jewel Kudjawu, intimated that though she is of the opinion that enough awareness has been created, there remains a poor attitude towards marine conservancy.

She lamented poor domestic waste management, indiscriminate housing projects, aided by traditional authorities, among other human activities are rendering efforts to rid the oceans off filth futile.

She revealed that this year the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), has decided to introduce a legally binding document on plastics, and she is hopeful when implemented by countries, the marine litter situation will be drastically mitigated.

She also disclosed the EPA is partnering with the Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation and other stakeholders such as the Fisheries Commission, the District Assemblies, to develop an integrated ocean management policy.

Mrs. Kudjawu said, “we have started working on it. We have a working group that has put the draft together. The draft will be taken to stakeholders to review so that they can make inputs, we revise and submit to cabinet for approval.”",en,"Ghana, Nungua","EPA, UNEA, the National Communications Authority, the Fisheries Commission, the United Nations Environment Assembly, the District Assemblies, the Environmental Protection Agency, Science, Technology and Innovation, The Centre for International Maritime Affairs, Ghana, CIMAG, Regional Maritime University, the National Petroleum Authority, the Ministry of Environment, The Ghana Maritime Authority, the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation","Jewel Kudjawu, Albert Fiatui","marine, ghana, cimag, policy, oceans, protection, ocean, maritime, director, management"

“We are committed to achieving the target of marine conservation areas covering an area of ​​32.5 million hectares by 2030. In 2021, we managed to protect an area of ​​28.1 million hectares or 86.5 percent. We are optimistic that our commitments in 2030 can be materialized,” the President said in his remarks during the One Ocean Summit 2022 broadcast on the Cabinet Secretariat’s YouTube channel, Friday (02/11).

The President also highlighted Indonesia’s commitment to reduce 70 percent of marine plastic waste by 2025.

According to him, to achieve this target, the Government continues to make a host of efforts, ranging from an action plan for handling marine plastic waste to the construction of a power plant made from waste that converts 1,000 tons of waste per day to 10 megawatts of electricity.

“The mangrove ecosystem is also our concern. We are targeting the rehabilitation of 600,000 hectares of mangroves by 2024. We believe all these efforts will not only bring an impact on the preservation of the marine environment and sustainable development, but also on climate change,” he added.

For the record, during COP26 last year, together with the Archipelagic and Island States Forum countries, Indonesia called for the importance of the link between the ocean and climate change.

“Indonesia believes that with international support, archipelagic countries and small island countries can be part of the solution,” President Jokowi said, adding that the management of the marine environment needs to be placed in the dimension of sustainable development and to be a part of supporting economic recovery from the impact of the pandemic.

“We have taken breakthrough measures, including a measured and quota-based fishing policy supported by an integrated technology-based surveillance system, as well as the development of aquaculture villages based on local wisdom for poverty alleviation and the preservation of high economic value commodities,” he explained.

The President further said that at the global level, Indonesia also continues to support the focus of marine issues.

“Indonesia’s G20 presidency will put emphasis on the importance of a blue economy, blue carbon, and handling marine debris. Indonesia stands ready to partner with all sides for the realization of a sustainable marine ecosystem,” he remarked.

Today, on June 8, we join the United Nations and the global community in celebrating the World Oceans Day with the theme “Revitalization -- Collective Action for the Ocean”.

It is a time when we pause and celebrate our ocean -- the ancestral home of all life on Earth. As humans, we may be separated by the continents, but it is the connectivity between nature and the ocean that sustains us, provides food and controls our climate. It is the ocean -- its diversity and vast ecosystems -- that sustains millions of people every day.

Despite disruptions on land, our ocean keeps on giving and sustaining life on the planet, providing benefits to billions of individuals and thousands of communities.",en,"Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia","The Jakarta Post, the United Nations",Rili Djohani,"ocean, global, june, day, life, indonesia, role, protection, sustainability, article"

The world's largest archipelagic nation also pledged to cut 70 percent of its marine plastic waste by 2025. To this end, Indonesia has been making various efforts, including the development of a waste power plant, which converts 1,000 tons of waste per day to generate 10-megawatt of electricity, according to Jokowi.

Indonesia also aims to rehabilitate 600,000 hectares of degraded mangroves by 2024. ambar puspa galuh

All these efforts would not only contribute to marine protection and sustainable development, but would also help combat climate change, the president added.

At Cop26’s Archipelagic and Island States Forum, Indonesia voiced the correlation between oceans and climate change.

“With international support, archipelagic states and small island countries can be part of the solution,” Jokowi said.

Jokowi also called for world leaders to place marine management within the dimension of sustainable development. Marine management should also be part of economic recovery efforts from the Covid-19 pandemic.

""We have made breakthrough steps, among others, by implementing a quota-based measured fishing policy that is supported by an integrated surveillance technology system. As well as the establishment of local wisdom-based aquaculture villages to eradicate poverty and preserve commodities of high economic value,” Jokowi said.

280,2022-07-29,North Coast Area of Interest for Marine Protected Area Designation,https://fairseas.ie/2022/07/29/north-donegal-coast-area-of-interest/,1002,993,9,0,fairseas.ie,Ireland,"Articles

North Coast Area of Interest for Marine Protected Area Designation.

The north Donegal coast was identified as a high biodiversity ‘Area of Interest’ for potential Marine Protected Area designation, in our recent report ‘Revitalising Our Seas.

For the full site synopsis and references please find the relevant pages of the report PDF here.

Size of the area: 3,744km² // 0.77% of Ireland’s Maritime Area.

Why was this area identified as a potential Marine Protected Area?

Ireland’s north coast is a wild, breathtaking and largely untamed place. So much so in fact, that in 2017 Donegal was named the world’s ‘coolest destination’ by National Geographic.

Elasmobranches (sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras)

Basking sharks are seen in large numbers along the north coast, especially around Malin Head. Between 60 to 75 individuals have been seen here in a single sighting.

Marine Institute surveys found this area to have one of the highest average catches per haul of tope sharks. Globally tope sharks are classed as ‘Critically Endangered’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and classed as ‘vulnerable’ in Irish waters. The main threat to this species is overexploitation for commercial fishing as there is still allowable catch even though evidence shows the species is declining.

Thornback skate are found across this area and Lough Swilly is a refuge site for the critically endangered flapper skate, the largest skate in the world, reaching up to 2.85 metres in length. The flapper skate was once the most common skate in the northeast Atlantic but due to overexploitation and habitat destruction, it has now disappeared from most of the areas it once lived. Protecting critical areas for these species could give them a true chance to come back from the brink.

Cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises)

Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises are found along the north coast year-round, with particularly high concentrations of both species at the mouth of Lough Swilly.

Killer whales have been observed on seven occasions throughout the north coast, most frequently at the mouth of Lough Swilly. Further offshore, closer to the continental shelf edge, groups of 75 killer whales were recorded by the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group Sightings Scheme. Recent research on the North Atlantic killer whale population suggests foraging movements from the southern coast of Norway to the northwest coast of Ireland around the pelagic trawl fisheries targeting mackerel and horse mackerel.

Sightings of minke whales occurred along the coast of North Donegal, with higher densities recorded off Bloody Foreland. Occasional sightings have also been made of other species passing through the area including humpback whales, Risso’s dolphins, and common dolphins.

Commercially Exploited Species

The largest herring spawning grounds in the country are located north of Donegal. Some of these grounds are located within this proposed MPA. Whiting spawning grounds also cover this entire area. Historic herring spawning grounds have disappeared from much of the Irish coast, therefore, we now have the chance to preserve the last of these areas to help rebuild numbers.

Seabirds

The Cliffs from Horn Head to Fanad Head are home to important colonies of seabirds of high conservation concern such as kittiwakes, razorbills and puffins. Lough Swilly provides sanctuary for breeding terns, black guillemots and black-headed gulls. Tory Island and Inishtrahull are rich in seabird diversity. Bloody Foreland has been identified as of major importance to migrating birds with more than 31,000 seabirds and 24 species recorded over a four-year period. The waters in this area are also utilised by birds hailing from Scottish colonies.

Special Areas of Conservation (SACs)

Several small Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are already designated for reefs, large shallow inlets and bays, intertidal mudflats and sandflats, sea caves, estuaries and coastal lagoons in this area. This larger Area of Interest would create corridors between these SACs. Mulroy Bay, in particular, is a very important site for seabed habitats, with maerl, seagrass and horse mussels all recorded here.

We are recommending that the government use the ‘whole site approach’ when it comes to designating MPAs. This means that rather than just protecting an individual species in an area, that protection can be given to the wider ecosystem they rely on.

The North Coast Area of Interest is abundant in marine life, including critically endangered species. By creating a Marine Protected Area biodiversity can have the chance to recover. As noted by Professor Mark Costello in the foreword of ‘Revitalising Our Seas’, “If properly planned, MPAs can lead to more stable and sustainable coastal fisheries, with added benefits of increased tourism and public enjoyment of marine life.

Fair Seas want Ireland to become a world leader in marine protection.

The group of charities have hit out at our slow pace of progress compared with other EU countries.



The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage first announced plans to increase Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to 30% by 2030 in 2019.

Ireland has a maritime area seven times the size of its land mass - but just 2.13% of that area is legally protected from activities that damage their habitats, wildlife and natural processes through MPAs.

That’s despite 65% of the country’s coastal habitats being in ‘unfavourable condition’ according to the Environmental Protection Agency while iconic species like porbeagle and angle sharks have declined 90%.

Seabird colonies like those that are home to the Atlantic puffin and blue whales are also threatened with extinction in our waters.

But so far, no real changes have been made.



A new report from Fair Seas Ireland, however, shows how it’s possible to protect 36% of Ireland’s ocean territory enabling the country to meet its 2030 European targets.



They say it will help protect, conserve and restore vulnerable and important species and habitats, as well as ensuring they can act as huge natural carbon stores.



The new research identifies 16 ‘Areas of Interest’ for MPA designation in Irish waters including eight coastal areas stretching all around the Republic of Ireland coast.



Fair Seas Campaign Manager Aoife O’Mahony said: “We’ve used scientific research and available data to identify the potential areas most in need of protection.



“Our ambition is to see Ireland become a world leader in marine protection, giving our species, habitats and coastal communities the opportunity to thrive.”



Oonagh Duggan, Head of Advocacy at BirdWatch Ireland, added: “Ireland is a laggard when it comes to protecting and restoring nature on land and sea.



“We have been endowed with a wealth of marine life but are squandering it.

“Our extensive coastline supports hundreds and thousands of breeding seabirds but species like the Puffin and Kittiwake are now globally vulnerable.



“Irish Kittiwake populations declined by 32% between 2002-2018. While seabirds have some protection on land where they breed, there’s no protection for them at sea where they forage for food.



“Ireland’s sea territory is huge, it’s high time to protect and restore large areas for these and other marine life.”



The report ‘Revitalising Our Seas - Identifying Areas of Interest for MPA Designation in Irish Waters’ was written the Irish Wildlife Trust’s marine policy and research officer Regina Classen, Birdwatch Ireland’s seabird MPA researcher Sarah Hegarty, Irish Whale and Dolphin Group’s marine mammal ecologist Hannagh Keogh and its education and outreach officer Sibéal Regan.



Mark John Costello, a marine professor at Nord University Norway, authored the foreword.



He said: “If properly planned, Marine Protected Areas can lead to more stable and sustainable coastal fisheries, with added benefits of increased tourism and public enjoyment of marine life.



“While a majority of the public in Ireland support the need to have MPA in principle, there will be objections to exactly where they are located, their boundaries, and rules.



“That is why discussions with local communities need to start as soon as possible, with political support to implement what is best for Ireland in the long term.”



The Fair Seas campaign includes Irish Wildlife Trust, BirdWatch Ireland, Sustainable Water Network, Friends of the Irish Environment, Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, Coomhola Salmon Trust, Irish Environmental Network and Coastwatch.



It is funded by Oceans 5, Blue Nature Alliance, BFCT and The Wyss Foundation.

A resolution tabled by Ireland South MEP Grace O’Sullivan has secured the backing of the European Parliament for a ban on gas and oil exploration in the Arctic ocean as part of an overall package to protect coastlines.

As well as banning the exploration of oil and gas, the motion which puts Ireland’s oceans at the heart of the European Green Deal, according to the Irish MEP, aims to defend coasts against plastic product pollution, protects 30% of Irish waters and puts a definitive end to whaling in the North Atlantic where the practice still continues.

The move in the European Parliament comes as nearly half of all habitats surveyed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service in recent years have declined in status, with 85% now in an inadequate condition.

This includes fragile ecosystems popular with Irish holidaymakers and residents like Roaringwater Bay, Cork.

The call to ban oil and gas exploration in the Arctic is a first for a European Parliament motion.

Grace O’Sullivan, who spent over 10 years at sea as an activist with Greenpeace, said she wanted to get a strong resolution on the record from the European Parliament ahead of the upcoming COP15 in Montreal in December.

""The COP15 is a conference that helps guide international responses to the terrifying collapse in biodiversity which we are also witnessing in Ireland.

“While many species on land struggle to deal with changing temperatures, that impact is even more difficult for marine biodiversity, where a fraction of a degree change can wipe out entire areas.

""It can also see explosions in populations like jellyfish or algal blooms, which is not good for the delicate balance of the oceans.”

Ms. O’Sullivan said that Ireland, as one of the only island nations in the EU, and Irish leaders should be spearheading all efforts to protect the sea from destructive activities likes mining and dredging as well as from plastic and fertiliser pollution.

“I hope to see the Government designate Marine Protected Areas as a matter of priority in the coming months to show we are leaders in climate action.”

Grace O’Sullivan is MEP for Ireland South, which includes 12 counties: Carlow, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Kilkenny, Laois, Limerick, Offaly, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow. She is a former Greenpeace activist having crewed the Rainbow Warrior when it was bombed by French Intelligence in 1985.

A new coalition of environmental groups has identified 16 sites in Irish waters it says should urgently be declared Marine Protected Areas.

They are home to critically endangered sharks, vital seabird colonies and 15 types of whales and dolphins.

They also provide feeding and breeding grounds for animals threatened with extinction such as Atlantic puffins and blue whales.

Just 2pc of Ireland’s coastal and ocean territory has protected status. While the Government has pledged to expand that to 30pc by 2030, the Fair Seas coalition says faster action is needed.

The 16 sites it has identified in a 240-page report – eight in coastal areas and eight in the open sea – make up 36pc of the country’s marine territory.

Designation as a Marine Protected Area (MPA) would not automatically rule out fishing, wind turbines or other commercial activities but would set boundaries for acceptable use.

“Ireland needs a core of fully protected MPAs representative of its species and habitats that can be a reference for human effects elsewhere,” said Mark John Costello, a professor of marine ecology.

“Another set of MPAs may allow some uses, for example low footprint finfish, shellfish and/or seaweed aquaculture, fishing that does not damage habitats, and energy generation, using the fully protected MPA to gauge their effects.

""These MPAs should be nested within a comprehensive strategy for sustainable use based on the precautionary principle, for all of Ireland’s seas.”

Fair Seas includes non-governmental environmental groups such as the Irish Wildlife Trust, BirdWatch Ireland, the Sustainable Water Network, Coastwatch, the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group and Friends of the Irish Environment.

The Government said last March it was drawing up legislation that would allow for designation of protected areas and gathering data on what areas should receive designation.

Oonagh Duggan of BirdWatch Ireland said there was no time to lose.

“Ireland is a laggard when it comes to protecting and restoring nature on land and sea,” she said.

“We have been endowed with a wealth of marine life but are squandering it.”

The report acknowledges concerns the fishing industry may have about restricting marine activity, but cites international examples where MPAs allowed fish stocks to replenish – which boosted smaller coastal fisheries.

Fair Seas campaign manager Aoife O’Mahony said: “This report is about kick-starting the conversation among stakeholders and decision-makers nationwide.”",en,"Co Wexford, Ireland","BirdWatch Ireland, Friends of the Irish Environment, Marine Protected Area, Coastwatch, MPAs, the Irish Wildlife Trust, the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, the Sustainable Water Network","Aoife O’mahony, John Murphy, Mark Costello, Oonagh Duggan","marine, ireland, seas, irish, fair, areas, mpas, sites, coastal, report"
284,2022-07-29,North Donegal coast identified as potential marine protected area,https://www.inishlive.ie/news/local-news/872744/north-donegal-coast-identified-as-potential-marine-protected-area.html,23,23,0,0,inishlive.ie,Ireland,"North Donegal's coast has been identified as high biodiversity ‘Area of Interest’ for potential Marine Protected Area (MPA) designation, in a recent report by Fair Seas, a coalition of Irish environmental non-governmental organizations (eNGOs).

The report points out that only 2% of Ireland's seas are currently protected.

Fair Seas is urging the Government to meet its target of increasing this to at least 30% by 2030, informed by the best scientific data and early and continuous stakeholder engagement. Fair Seas has identified 16 ‘Areas of Interest’ for Marine Protected Area designation in Irish waters.

The ‘North Coast Area of Interest’ covers 3,744km² and is rich in biodiversity. Basking sharks are seen in large numbers, especially around Malin Head, where between 60 to 75 individuals have been seen in a single sighting. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises are found along the north coast year-round, with particularly high numbers at the mouth of Lough Swilly.

Marine Institute surveys found this area to have one of the highest average catches per haul of tope shark. The tope shark is listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Threat

The main threat to this species is overexploitation from commercial fishing as there is still allowable catch even though evidence shows it is declining. Thornback skates are found across this area and Lough Swilly is a refuge site for the critically endangered flapper skate, the largest skate in the world, reaching up to 2.85 metres in length.

The largest herring spawning grounds in the country are located north of Donegal. Some of these grounds are located within this proposed MPA. Whiting spawning grounds also cover this entire area. Historic herring spawning grounds have disappeared from much of the Irish coast; therefore, protection must be given to ensure the last of these areas are not lost forever.

The cliffs from Horn Head to Fanad Head are home to important colonies of seabirds of high conservation concern such as kittiwake, razorbill and puffin. Lough Swilly provides sanctuary for breeding terns, black guillemots and black-headed gulls. Tory Island and Inishtrahull are rich in seabird diversity. Bloody Foreland is of major importance to migrating birds with more than 31,000 seabirds and 24 species recorded over a four-year period.

Fishing communities

MPAs allow species and habitats to recover and thrive while benefiting fishing communities and coastal economies. The ocean is the largest carbon store on Earth, so MPAs have huge potential to fight climate change.

As noted by Professor Mark Costello in the foreword of ‘Revitalising Our Seas’: “If properly planned, MPAs can lead to more stable and sustainable coastal fisheries, with added benefits of increased tourism and public enjoyment of marine life.

""There is no evidence of any MPA anywhere in the world reducing fishery catch. There are many examples of MPAs restoring fished populations and these restored stocks consequently repopulating adjacent areas where they contribute to fisheries.”",en,"Donegal, Ireland","Fair Seas, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, IUCN",Mark Costello,"area, coast, marine, seas, north, grounds, mpas, donegal, potential, high"

South East Coast Area of Interest for Marine Protected Area Designation

Size of the area: 7,124km²

The east coast of Ireland was identified as a high biodiversity ‘Area of Interest’ for potential Marine Protected Area designation, in our recent report ‘Revitalising Our Seas’.

For the full site synopsis and references please find the relevant pages of the report PDF here.

Why was this area identified as a potential Marine Protected Area?

There is a 130km long and 20km wide cod spawning ground running parallel to the south coast of Ireland, which is one of only two cod spawning grounds in Irish waters. Between 2005-2021 16% of fin whale sightings within Ireland’s EEZ occurred within this site, accounting for 14% of the overall total number of individuals. Fourteen percent of Risso’s dolphin sightings occurred within this site, accounting for 10% of the overall total number of individuals. Seabirds with colonies on the east coast of Ireland, as well as the coast of Wales and Cornwall in England depend on this area for vital foraging during chick-rearing. The majority of the newly arrived Mediterranean gull breeding occurs here at Lady’s Island Lake, which is also a hotspot for terns and black-headed gulls.

Commercially exploited species

Several commercially exploited species use this area as spawning and/or nursing grounds, including herring, cod, haddock and whiting. With only one of two cod spawning grounds in Irish waters occurring here, it is vital that this area be given protection to conserve these fish. While there is currently no evidence of spawning site fidelity for sprat, high catches of juveniles are observed in groundfish surveys in this area. A large proportion of sprat landings are from in and around the Waterford Estuary. Protection of sprat is important, as it is a primary food source for many seabirds and cetaceans.

Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras)

Areas south of Hook Head and towards the UK border showed high elasmobranch species richness with nine species recorded in several areas. Spurdog, thornback ray and tope occur in high densities in this area. An average 11 individuals of tope were caught in groundfish survey hauls off the coast of Wexford, which is one of the highest densities in the country.

Habitats

The seabed in this Area of Interest is very diverse, consisting of roughly equal parts of sand and coarse sediment, with muddy patches and rocky substrate also present. Circalittoral rock is present from the coastline out to 4.5 nm. Large parts of these rocky areas occur in existing Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), especially Hook Head SAC and the Saltee Islands SAC. In the shallow parts of these areas, large kelp forests are known to exist, while deeper areas are characterised by sponge and sea squirt communities.

Seabirds

This Area of Interest is a true hotspot of seabird activity, with 34 of the 38 total species identified within the explored data occurring in this region. The highest level of species richness occurs in this area, with 28 different species recorded at at least one point in time off Carnsore Point in Wexford, which is a major migration bottleneck. The Seatrack migration survey recorded approximately 43,000 birds over a four-year period (2010- 2103) with consistently high diversity each year (21-23 species present). Several key colonies exist within this Area of Interest. Internationally important colonies of roseate terns and Sandwich terns are located at Lady’s Island Lake. The Saltees Islands host large colonies of gannets, guillemots, razorbills, puffins, kittiwakes, and cormorants. A large gannet colony lies just across the border in Wales (Grassholm).

Cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises)

High cetacean species diversity was recorded in this area generally at lower densities for most species compared to other sites. High densities of fin whales were recorded close to the coast, observed every month except March and April. High densities of Risso’s dolphins were recorded off Carnsore Point, particularly in the summer months. Moderate to high densities of harbour porpoise are distributed adjacent to the coast. Presence recorded year-round with greater sightings during January, July and November. Minke whales are also recorded here with high concentrations recorded off Helvick Head. Presence was observed year-round with the exception of February. Humpback whales and bottlenose dolphins are not as common in this area as in others. Killer whales were sighted on a small number of occasions and common dolphins are abundant throughout the site.

Fair Seas published the report Revitalising Our Seas in June 2022 and identified sixteen areas of interest for potential Marine Protected Area designation in Irish waters. The report aims to help kickstart the conversation around MPAs within the government and among stakeholders. MPAs can help to restore life in our seas to what they once were and can benefit coastal fisheries and local economies.

Southwest Coast Area of Interest for Marine Protected Area Designation

Size of the area: 7,333km²

The southwest coast of Ireland was identified as a high biodiversity ‘Area of Interest’ for potential Marine Protected Area designation, in our recent report ‘Revitalising Our Seas’.

For the full site synopsis and references please find the relevant pages of the report PDF here.

Why was this area identified as a potential Marine Protected Area?

Whales, whales and more whales. Our analysis has shown the waters off West Cork to be a real hotspot for the largest whales that visit our coast with the highest numbers of fin whales and Risso’s dolphins seen here. The waters off the southwest coast provide spawning and nursery grounds for commercially important fish species and act as a major migration route for all kinds of seabirds.

Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras)

This area has the highest amount of basking shark sightings in the country, with over 30% of all sightings recorded from this area. Single sightings often report multiple individuals, mostly between 10 and 20, and one sighting recorded the highest number of individuals ever recorded of around 100 sharks seen south of Rosscarbery.

Cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises)

The highest number of fin whales recorded in Irish waters are seen within the ‘Southwest Coast Area of Interest’. 6,123 individual fin whales have been recorded in the area between 2005 and 2021. This accounts for 49% of all the fin whales seen around Ireland. Another gentle giant seen off Ireland’s Southwest coast is the humpback whale. More and more people are getting the chance to see these incredibly charismatic animals with their own eyes with 2,747 individuals seen off the southwest between 2005 and 2021. These ocean giants flock to our waters to feed. Humpback and fin whales are filter-feeding ‘Baleen’ or ‘Rorqual’ whales. They feed on small fish like sprat and sand eels or on plankton.

The highest numbers of Risso’s Dolphins are seen in the area with a whopping 3,904 individuals recorded in the same periods as above (2005 – 2021). Minke whales are a common sight to keen-eyed coast goers in this area with harbour porpoises and common dolphins also regularly seen.

Some common dolphin sightings note that groups of up to 2,000 individuals have been seen at any one time. This is what is sometimes called a ‘super pod’. Between 2005 and 2021 55% of all the individual common dolphins recorded in Ireland were seen off the southwest coast totalling a staggering 296,489 individuals! Eight encounters of common dolphins with calves were observed predominantly during the month of October.

Cork Harbour is home to a resident group of eight bottlenose dolphins. These local individuals are related to the dolphins of the Shannon SAC on the west coast. A solitary dolphin also calls Cork Harbour home.

Killer whales were recorded in this area sporadically as well as Atlantic white-sided dolphins and long-finned pilot whales.

Commercially exploited species

A large whiting spawning and nursery ground passes through this area. There are also several small herring spawning and nursery grounds and a large haddock spawning ground is located around 13km off the southwest coastline.

While there is currently no evidence of spawning site fidelity for sprat, high catches of juveniles are observed in groundfish surveys in this area (Marine Institute, 2021). A large proportion of sprat landings are from inner Bantry and Kenmare Bays, including in Kenmare River SAC. Protection of sprat is important, as it is a primary food source for many seabirds and cetaceans.

Habitats and seabed features

Bantry, Kenmare and Roaringwater bays are very diverse in terms of seabed habitats. There are several seagrass beds along this stretch of coast that are not currently protected, including several inside Bantry Bay.

Also of note are the rich kelp forests within Bantry Bay and along the south coast which urgently need protection. The south coast has few Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), and all are very small inshore sites. This represents a major gap in Ireland’s inshore MPA network. By creating an MPA in this area we have the opportunity to link up these SACs and to afford protection to the wider ecosystem that supports an incredible array of marine life.

Seabirds

This Area of Interest is one of the most diverse areas for seabird species in Ireland. It acts as a virtual gateway for seabirds travelling to Ireland, as the ocean’s currents split here with water either heading up the west coast or alternatively along the south coast. This phenomenon attracts a high diversity of seabird species, offering easy access and transit to many rich coastal habitats like those found in Roaringwater Bay and Bantry Bay.

Bull Rock is one of the six gannet colonies (gannetries) in Ireland, and Cape Clear is an important migration bottleneck region. There have also been sightings of the critically endangered Balearic shearwater on occasion.

This year the 15th International Seabird Conference will be held in Cork. For those attending the conference, Birdwatch Ireland and Fair Seas will be running a workshop at the conference on ‘What does effective management in Marine Protected Areas look like for Ireland’s seabirds?’. Workshop participants will be asked what they want to see in the management of Marine Protected Areas in Irish waters and how effective management should be achieved for Ireland’s seabird populations.

Full details of the workshop can be found on the Birdwatch Ireland website.

“Having the International Seabird Group Conference take place in Cork this year is a great opportunity to highlight this area’s importance for seabirds and marine biodiversity. The Southwest Coast AOI is one of the most diverse areas for seabirds in Irish waters, and the region includes one of Ireland’s major migration bottlenecks at Cape Clear which is one of the best places for birdwatching in the country. On top of that, the area is also vitally important for whales, dolphins and basking sharks, with some of Ireland’s richest areas for whales and dolphins found in this region.” – Sinéad Loughran, Birdwatch Ireland Marine Policy and Advocacy Officer

Fair Seas published the report Revitalising Our Seas in June 2022 and identified sixteen areas of interest for potential Marine Protected Area designation in Irish waters. The report aims to help kickstart the conversation around MPAs within the government and among stakeholders. MPAs can help to restore life in our seas to what they once were and can benefit coastal fisheries and local economies.

Loop Head to Kenmare Area of Interest for Marine Protected Area Designation

Size of the area: 6,705km²

The east coast of Ireland was identified as a high biodiversity ‘Area of Interest’ for potential Marine Protected Area designation, in our recent report ‘Revitalising Our Seas’.

For the full site synopsis and references please find the relevant pages of the report PDF here.

Why was this area identified as a potential Marine Protected Area?

Tralee and Dingle Bays are breeding areas for several threatened species of shark, ray and skate. This ‘Area of Interest’ for cetaceans, exhibits a high number of bottlenose dolphins in Brandon Bay and to a lesser extent Tralee Bay. It is used regularly by individual bottlenose dolphins from the adjacent Shannon Estuary Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The highest numbers of humpback whales are recorded in this area, 51% of the overall total number of individuals. The islands and archipelagos that skirt the peninsulas of Kerry are some of Ireland’s most prominent seabird breeding sites.

At the most westerly point of Europe, these striking nearshore islands annually accommodate aggregations of seabirds on an internationally significant scale, particularly for burrow-nesting seabird species such as Manx shearwater, puffin, and storm-petrel. By far the largest of Ireland’s six gannetries is located within this site (Little Skellig).

Recently Fair Seas visited communities across parts of Kerry that would be encompassed by this Marine Protected Area. We interviewed all sorts of people that make their living from and by the sea. We spoke to a wide range of people including fishermen, anglers, ecotourism operators and more. In October we hope to screen the film around Kerry and the rest of the county to continue the conversation of protecting our seas among all our coastal communities.

Seabirds

Within this AOI lies the Bridges of Ross, not far from Loop Head in Clare, which is an important migration bottleneck, with almost 60,000 birds recorded during a three-year survey period. Heading south towards Tralee Bay are the Magharee Islands, a network of small rocky outcrops popular with breeding terns (Arctic tern and Sandwich tern). At the most westerly point of Europe can be found the Blasket Islands, with several colonies of international importance for Manx shearwater and European storm petrel, and several other noteworthy colonies of lesser black-backed gull, puffin, razorbill and fulmar.

Off the next peninsula to the south, Uíbh Ráthach as Gaeilge or Iveragh in English, are the Skellig Islands, which are of equal significance, providing ideal nesting habitat for internationally important colonies of northern gannet, European storm-petrel and puffin. With the last census estimating in excess of 35,000 breeding pairs of gannets, this colony represents 74% of the national breeding population.

The thousands of puffins on Skellig Michael (Great Skellig) and Puffin Island are an iconic sight for both domestic and international tourism. The largest puffin colony was previously the aptly named Puffin Island, with the Seabird 2000 census showing the island to be inhabited by over a quarter (26%) of Ireland’s estimated breeding population. It is also an internationally important colony for European storm-petrel. However, new data yet to be published suggests that recent estimates on Great Skellig may surpass the colony size of Puffin Island. The Critically Endangered Balearic shearwater, although scarce, has been observed around the Blasket and Skellig Islands in the past.

Habitats

This Area of Interest covers several important inshore bays and estuaries, including ones that are already designated SACs or Special Areas of Conservation (SPAs), e.g. the Shannon Estuary, Tralee and Brandon Bays, Dingle Bay, the Blaskets, Valentia Island and Kenmare Bay. Proper management of these sites would already contribute substantially to the protection of habitats within them. That said, SACs and SPAs only afford protection to a small subset of listed habitats and species. An extension of these sites into one larger MPA would allow movement between core areas of species and their habitats and – crucially – protect some species that might not currently be afforded protection within existing SACs.

Particular species of interest outside the current SAC network is seagrass meadows in Dingle Bay, kelp forests all along the coastline and the high variation in seabed habitat types, e.g. circalittoral rock between Loop Head and the Blaskets and circalittoral fine sand in the Shannon Estuary and Dingle Bay.

Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras)

Sharks, skates and rays are not protected inside the current network of SACs. Angling records and egg case surveys have highlighted the area (Tralee Bay in particular) as one of the last remaining hotspots and breeding areas for several threatened elasmobranchs. A survey of sharks, skates and rays in north Kerry (Tralee, Brandon and Dingle Bays) was conducted by the Marine Institute in 2017- 2019. A total of 12 species were captured during the survey, of which three are listed as Critically Endangered (angel shark, blue skate and flapper skate), two are listed as Endangered (stingray, undulate ray) and a further three are Vulnerable (tope, cuckoo ray, spurdog).

The survey report notes that the waters off north Kerry are internationally important as they hold some of the last remaining refuges for angel shark and white skate. While no adult white skates were found during the Marine Institute survey, the report states that Varian et al. (2020) recorded live egg cases of white skate in Tralee Bay. Analysis of the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group database and the ObSERVE survey data indicate high densities of basking sharks around the Blasket Islands. The Area of Interest has one of the highest levels of basking shark sightings in Ireland (21% of total sightings), with individual sightings reporting as many as 60 individuals present at one point.

Commercially exploited species

Whiting spawning grounds extend all along the south coast and up into Kenmare Bay. Whiting nursery habitat extends all along the southwest peninsulas and into Dingle Bay. Herring spawning grounds are more patchy, with grounds all around the Dingle Peninsula and a large spawning ground in the mouth of the River Shannon. Herring nursery grounds extend from Dingle Bay southwards to Bantry Bay. A haddock nursery ground is located west of the Dingle Peninsula. Cod nursery grounds are located all around the Irish coast.

Crayfish (Palinurus elephas) are globally classed as Vulnerable and declining. In the southwest of Ireland, crayfish populations have declined since the traditional pots were replaced by tangle nets in the 1970s. This type of fishing gear has a high bycatch rate of threatened sharks, skates and rays as well as seals, and is one of the main threats to the endangered elasmobranchs in this area. An ongoing project by the Marine Institute aims to improve the status of elasmobranchs and crayfish stocks by trialling the use of traps and creating a crayfish management plan with bycatch mitigation measures. The poor status of crayfish means it will greatly benefit from improved management of the area, which MPA designation could aid in.

Cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises)

High species richness has been recorded in this area. Studies have shown that Brandon Bay, and to a lesser extent Tralee Bay, are used regularly by individual bottlenose dolphins from the adjacent Shannon Estuary SAC, which is designated because of the species. Of the 70 dolphins recognised individually between 2008 and 2016 in the area, 95% had been recorded as part of the Shannon dolphin population. High densities were also recorded off Ventry Harbour, with the highest recorded at Loop Head.

High densities of harbour porpoise were recorded within the established Blasket Islands SAC, with lower densities throughout the rest of the site, distribution more south of Dunmore Head. High densities of humpback whales north and south of the Blasket Islands have been recorded. Sightings occurred from April to November, with peak sightings in August.

High densities of minke whales were recorded within the site south of the Blasket Islands, present year-round with the exception of January. High densities of Risso’s dolphin have been recorded south of the Blasket Islands and between Puffin Island and the Skellig Islands. Sightings occurred from March to November, with peak sightings in June. There were lower densities of fin whales across the site with small clusters around the Blasket Islands. Sightings occurred from April to November, with peak sightings in August. Small numbers of killer whales have been recorded here with several sightings over the summer of 2022.

Fair Seas published the report Revitalising Our Seas in June 2022 and identified sixteen areas of interest for potential Marine Protected Area designation in Irish waters. The report aims to help kickstart the conversation around MPAs within the government and among stakeholders. MPAs can help to restore life in our seas to what they once were and can benefit coastal fisheries and local economies.

Donegal to Sligo Area of Interest for Marine Protected Area Designation

Size of the area: 1,433km² // 0.29% of Ireland’s Maritime Area

The coast from south Donegal to Sligo was identified as a high biodiversity ‘Area of Interest’ for potential Marine Protected Area designation, in our recent report ‘Revitalising Our Seas’.

For the full site synopsis and references please find the relevant pages of the report PDF here.

Why was this area identified as a potential Marine Protected Area?

The Donegal to Sligo Area of Interest is home to many breeding seabirds as well as endangered sharks, skates and rays. Some areas potentially act as nursery grounds for bottlenose dolphins and their calves. While Minke whales seem to favour the waters around St. Johns Point. Many Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) already exist within the Donegal to Sligo Area of Interest. Creating a larger MPA would connect these smaller protected sites and allow for an interconnected network of protection for the wider ecosystem. The Area of Interest stretches from Glencolumbkille in Donegal to Easky in county Sligo and would cover a stretch of sea the size of 112 GAA pitches.

Elasmobranches (sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras)

Eight species of elasmobranches have been recorded in one area of inner Donegal bay. These include threatened species such as spurdog, thornback ray, tope and flapper skate. High numbers of spurdog and thornback skate were especially noticed.

Cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises)

Between 2005 and 2021, eight different species of whales, dolphins and porpoises have been recorded in this area. Bottlenose dolphins were recorded along the coast, with high numbers seen off St. Johns Point and Mullaghmore, and in Sligo Bay. June to August seems to be the busiest time for dolphins visiting this area.

A number of studies show Donegal Bay is well known for the presence of bottlenose dolphins. Photo identification has shown the same individuals use this bay on a regular basis. A study by Milaja Nykänen from UCC estimated that in 2014 189 individuals used the waters between the Mullet Peninsula and Donegal Bay. They also stated that while calves were encountered on most occasions, six calves were observed in Donegal Bay – the highest number recorded throughout the study. This study might indicate that Donegal Bay is an important site for mother bottlenose dolphins and their calves. Calves, like young children, are still learning and therefore it’s very important that we look after the nursery grounds they grow up in.

The same individual dolphins are seen year on year in this area, in scientific terms this is called ‘site-fidelity’, which indicates that for one reason or another this area is important to them. Fewer harbour porpoises were recorded in this Area of Interest than in others, although, they are recorded here all year long. Common dolphins in contrast were found throughout this area. Minke whales seem to be particularly high in numbers around St. John’s Point, compared to relatively low numbers observed across the rest of this area. Other species that have been recorded visiting the area include recent sightings of humpback whales, killer whales and Risso’s dolphins.

Commercially Exploited Species

Whiting spawn here from the northern coast of Mayo all the way to Donegal. A small herring spawning ground is also located near Killybegs and larger nursery grounds are located north of Sligo Bay and west of Donegal town.

While there is currently no evidence of spawning site fidelity for sprat, high catches of juvenile sprat are observed in Marine Institute groundfish surveys in this area. A large proportion of sprat landings come from Donegal Bay (Marine Institute, 2021). The protection of sprat is important, as it is a primary food source for many seabirds and cetaceans.

Seabirds

The Donegal to Sligo Area of Interest supports several important seabird colonies. Inishmurry is a small Island off the coast of Stredagh, Co. Sligo. The island is only 1700 metres long by 700 metres wide, yet it supports 8% of Ireland’s breeding shag population. The island is also a breeding site for lesser black-backed gulls and greater black-backed gulls. Ardboline and Horse Island are also known breeding sites for cormorants. Many other species occupy areas all along the sheltered coastline including kittiwake (~500 breeding pairs), razorbill (~90 pairs) and European storm-petrel (~280 pairs).

Fair Seas published the report Revitalising Our Seas in June 2022 and identified sixteen areas of interest for potential Marine Protected Area designation in Irish waters. The report aims to help kickstart the conversation around MPAs within the government and among stakeholders. MPAs can help to restore life in our seas to what they once were and can benefit coastal fisheries and local economies.

290,2022-08-06,"Government Approves ""Milestone"" in Marine Protected Area Legislation",https://afloat.ie/marine-environment/marine-planning/item/55688-government-approves-milestone-in-marine-protected-area-legislation,8,5,3,0,afloat.ie,Ireland,"The Government has approved development of a general scheme of a Bill for designation and management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Ireland’s maritime territory.

The approval has been welcomed by Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage Darragh O’Brien, who is responsible for marine planning, and Minister of State for Heritage and Electoral Reform Malcolm Noonan.

“As an island nation, our seas and our ocean are absolutely crucial for Ireland,” Mr O’Brien said.

“They support our economy, inward and outward trade, our energy supply and communications systems, as well as our climate, our environment, our cultural traditions and heritage, our health and well-being,” he said.

“As an island nation, our seas and our ocean are absolutely crucial for Ireland”

“In order to ensure that our seas remain clean, healthy and productive, and our unique habitats and biodiversity are protected, we are committed to designating a network of up to 30% of our maritime area as MPAs by 2030,” he said.

Mr Noonan described the development of the legislation as “an important milestone as we work to progress Ireland’s network of MPAs”.

“ It will provide us with strong powers to help address the twin environmental crises of biodiversity loss and climate change by protecting and conserving the marine ecosystems that underpin the essential and multifaceted services that coastal communities and wider society depend on, such as fishing, tourism, cultural heritage, climate regulation and resilience to environmental change,”Mr Noonan said.

“In the context of energy security and the ramping up of Ireland’s offshore renewable energy ambitions, it’s all the more important that we work at pace to deliver on our commitment to meeting both biodiversity and climate objectives,” he said.

The legislation will provide for the identification, designation, regulation, management, enforcement and review of MPAs, ensuring that they form a coherent, connected, representative and climate-resilient network.

It aims to make key provisions for public and stakeholder participation and engagement in relation to the MPA process.

It will also make provisions for implementation and enforcement structures and will be designed to work in parallel with the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 and existing legal protection measures under the Wildlife Acts and the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.

The ministers said it is intended that the heads of the Bill will be brought to Government for approval “as soon as possible”, with work on drafting and enacting the primary MPA legislation “expected to follow thereafter”.",en,Ireland,"Government, State","Malcolm Noonan, Darragh O’brien","ireland, climate, government, marine, legislation, mpas, heritage, area, maritime, noonan"

The EU's flagship European Green Deal initiative has lit a fire under its member states to implement significant changes to ocean conservation, including an ambitious target to protect at least 30% of EU waters by 2030. A figure which for Ireland only stands at about 2% currently. A new Action Plan to conserve fisheries resources and protect marine ecosystems is expected from the European Commission in the coming days, as is a Commission review of EU fisheries policy with practices such as bottom trawling facing renewed scrutiny. New regulations under the Fit for 55 package this year aim to encourage maritime shipping towards decarbonisation.

Meanwhile, a Directive requiring EU coastal states to adopt maritime spatial plans aims to lay the groundwork for offshore renewables and marine protected area designation. This has led the Irish government to completely overhaul the marine planning process recently, paving the way for new legislation on a network of Marine Protected Areas to meet those targets.

Marking the day as the European Parliament plenary session takes place in Strasbourg, MEP for Ireland South Grace O'Sullivan remarked; ""Report after report in recent years has shown us that the window of opportunity for us to reverse climate change is closing fast. Producing half of our oxygen, and absorbing over a third of CO2 emissions, one of the most important elements in the fight against climate change is the Ocean. On the ground in Ireland communities have recognised this, such as the Clean Coasts campaign organising beach clean-ups across the country this week. It is time EU and national policy pays as much attention to keeping our oceans pristine. This is the year for action, and it may be our last chance to reverse the biodiversity decline seen in recent decades.""",en,"Lisbon, Strasbourg, Ireland","South Green Party, United Nations, the European Commission, the United Nations, EU, Commission, the European Parliament, European Parliament","South O'sullivan, Grace O'sullivan","eu, marine, ireland, european, oceans, day, mep, ocean, new, united"

293,2022-07-01,Press Release: UN Oceans Conference - Fair Seas welcomes Ireland’s €10 million funding announcement for overseas marine protection | FairSeas,https://fairseas.ie/2022/07/01/fair-seas-irelands-e10-million-funding-announcement-for-overseas-marine-protection/,0,0,0,0,fairseas.ie,Ireland,"Press Releases

On Tuesday 28th June, at the United Nations Ocean Conference in Lisbon, Portugal, Minister of State for Heritage and Electoral Reform, Minister Noonan announced that Ireland will provide €10 million in funding to address ocean challenges faced by developing countries including Small Island Developing States.

Fair Seas highly commends the Irish Government for supporting marine conservation in the global ocean and making funds available for developing countries to protect their marine heritage and biodiversity. Access to adequate funding and resources is essential for Small Island states to tackle the myriad of ocean threats which impact local biodiversity and communities. Projects such as The Blue Action Fund for example, whose mission is to ‘enhance the management and use of coastal and marine ecosystems to conserve marine biodiversity by making targeted grants to non-governmental organisations active in developing countries is critical to the long-term conservation and health of the marine environment.

“This substantial financial investment shows Ireland’s support for conserving ocean biodiversity globally, and Fair Seas look forward to seeing similar investments in marine conservation efforts at the national level.” adds Aoife O’Mahony, Fair Seas Campaign Manager.

The Irish Government have committed to protecting 30% of our ocean by 2030, yet progress towards that target is lacking, while 65% of monitored coastal habitats are in unfavourable condition. Ireland needs to turn the tide on this decline. By accelerating the conversation with stakeholders, local communities and groups on how it will introduce new Marine Protected Areas, Ireland will not only help achieve healthy and productive ecosystems locally but will be doing our bit for marine protection and conservation at the European and global level too.

This is why Fair Seas are calling on the Irish Government to designate an effective, well-managed network of Marine Protected Areas covering at least 30% of Irish waters by 2030. To that end, Fair Seas recently published a report identifying 16 high biodiversity Areas of Interest in Irish waters which if properly protected, could significantly contribute to the improvement in the health of our seas and the wildlife in them. The time to act is now.

“Thank you Ireland for the generous contribution to protect marine biodiversity, particularly joining Blue Action Fund, one of the most effective sources of public funding for the ocean,” said Seth Horstmeyer, Program Director for Oceans 5, an international funder collaborative supporting the Fair Seas Coalition. “Today’s announcement demonstrates true leadership by supporting the global effort to protect the ocean while advancing 30 percent protection in Ireland’s waters.”

The Fair Seas campaign is led by a coalition of Ireland’s leading environmental non-governmental organisations and networks including Irish Wildlife Trust, BirdWatch Ireland, Sustainable Water Network, Friends of the Irish Environment, Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, Coomhola Salmon Trust, Irish Environmental Network and Coastwatch. It is funded by Oceans 5, Blue Nature Alliance, BFCT and The Wyss Foundation.

The report “Revitalising Our Seas – Identifying Areas of Interest for MPA Designation in Irish Waters” is authored by Regina Classen, Marine Policy and Research Officer, Irish Wildlife Trust; Sarah Hegarty, Seabird MPA Researcher, Birdwatch Ireland; Hannah Keogh, Marine Mammal Ecologist, Irish Whale and Dolphin Group and Sibéal Regan, Education and Outreach Officer, Irish Whale and Dolphin Group.

The funding commitment includes;

€5 million over three years to the Blue Action Fund to enhance the management and use of coastal and marine ecosystems in developing countries while improving the lives of local people.

€3.8 million over five years for the Our Shared Ocean Programme to facilitate research partnerships between Irish and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) based institutions.

€600,000 for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), to promote equitable and inclusive development of coastal areas in Tanzania with a focus on marginalised women and girls.

€300,000 to the World Bank PROBLUE Trust Fund, specifically for activities in the Caribbean to support the sustainable and integrated development of marine and coastal resources.

€250,000 to Climate KIC to support innovation in the Blue Economy in Pacific Island Developing States through an enterprise support programme

Un accordo essenziale per proteggere almeno il 30% di un bene di fondamentale importanza e realizzare una rete di aree marine protette e Santuari, è stato mancato dopo due settimane di trattative a causa delle troppe divergenze tra i 168 paesi membri. Impossibile, a quanto pare, trovare un compromesso per l’istituzione di aree marine protette, il miglioramento qualitativo e quantitativo delle valutazioni di impatto ambientale, il rafforzamento delle capacità ai Paesi in via di sviluppo per dare anche il via a dei finanziamenti e la condivisione delle risorse genetiche marine (si parla di materiale biologico utile in diversi settori delle società contemporanee). Nonostante i vari negoziati vadano avanti da ben 15 anni, l’accordo ONU realmente finalizzato e applicato rimane la Convenzione delle Nazione Unite sul diritto del mare (UNCLOS), che risale al 1982; e mentre le manovre si arrestano, la crisi oceanica continua. E ad essere davvero protetta da aree marine riconosciute, ad oggi è solo l’1,2% della superficie oceanica.

Eppure gli esperti e le ricerche parlavano chiaro da tempo: è necessario prendere provvedimenti immediati per proteggere il 30% degli oceani del mondo entro il 2030. Il cosiddetto obiettivo 30×30 è il minimo indispensabile per far sì che gli oceani recuperino ed evitare un pericoloso collasso della biodiversità marina. Nonostante quella descritta sia solo una partenza tanto esile quanto di estrema importanza, non si riesce a metterla in atto.

I recenti colloqui sul Trattato ONU, sono terminati lo scorso 27 agosto e non hanno portato a nulla di concreto a causa di divergenze nate perlopiù da parte dei paesi della High Ambition Coalition con aggiunta del Canada e degli Stati Uniti (eppure Biden ha recentemente promesso tutt’altro). La stessa Hingh Ambition Coalition (di cui fanno parte circa 61 paesi, tra cui l’Italia) che era stata creata in pompa magna proprio perché era “tempo di agire”, come si legge sul sito ufficiale.

Le difficoltà nate appaiono però più volute che casuali; come denuncia Greenpeace International che non si arrivasse a un accordo era prevedibile. Da parte dei membri della High Ambition Coalition non c’è stata la reale applicazione pratica delle teorie abbracciate durante l’osannata conferenza COP26 e «A meno che i ministri non convochino una riunione di emergenza nel 2022 per concludere i negoziati, la High Ambition Coalition e altri come gli Stati Uniti non hanno mantenuto l’impegno di arrivare a un Trattato quest’anno». Nello specifico ci si accorge che tra i punti più difficili da abbracciare durante le discussioni ci sia stato il tema dell’Artico.

La situazione al Polo Nord è tra le più preoccupanti, con un riscaldamento di almeno tre volte superiore al resto del mondo ma il fatto che lo scioglimento dei ghiacciai – devastante per l’ambiente – apra attraenti vie commerciali prima inesistenti, dia modo di sfruttare nuove risorse dei fondali, pare fare talmente gola da rendere sconveniente siglare ora un accordo che tutelerebbe tali aree, rendendole protette quindi inaccessibili per scopi commerciali o per il deep sea mining (cioè lo sfruttamento delle risorse minerarie tra i 2.000 e i 5.000 metri di profondità).

E quello fallito, ben il quinto meeting, sarebbe andato a buon fine se a decidere fossero stati alcuni Paesi come le isole del Pacifico e il Caribbean group, assolutamente volenterosi di adottare realmente un United Nations UN Ocean Treaty. Ancora una volta un accordo risolutivo per la protezione dell’ambiente è saltato anche, e forse soprattutto, a causa della mancata volontà da parte dei Paesi economicamente più avanzati.

296,2022-04-18,L'Unione Europea destina un miliardo di euro alla protezione degli oceani,https://www.lindipendente.online/2022/04/18/lunione-europea-destina-un-miliardo-di-euro-alla-protezione-degli-oceani/,67,64,3,0,lindipendente.online,Italy,"Ieri in occasione della conferenza Our Ocean (OOC) di Palau l’Unione Europea ha deciso di destinare un miliardo di euro per la protezione e il ripristino degli oceani. In quel che Bruxelles ha definito come l’impegno finanziario più cospicuo per l’economia blu, il piano dell’Unione Europea prevede 44 impegni per il periodo 2020-2022, dalla lotta all’inquinamento marino alla promozione di agricoltura e pesca sostenibili, l’introduzione di nuove aree marine protette e la salvaguardia di quelle esistenti, fino alla creazione di economie blu sostenibili, cosicché l’oceano diventi sempre più “Sicuro, giusto e protetto”. Non solo, ma centrali saranno gli stessi cittadini europei, i quali potranno rimanere costantemente aggiornati grazie all’apposito strumento di monitoraggio Copernicus.

La prima conferenza Our Ocean ha avuto luogo negli Stati Uniti nel 2014. Dall’anno di partenza è stato possibile proteggere circa cinque milioni di miglia quadrate di oceano, attraverso più di 1.400 impegni per un valore di circa 85 miliardi di euro. L’edizione del 2022 Our Ocean, Our People, Pur Prosperity (il nostro oceano, il nostro popolo, la nostra prosperità) si congiunge a un’attenzione crescente per la salvaguardia dell’ambiente, che vede una cooperazione internazionale sempre maggiore per la salvaguardia del Pianeta, dov’è chiaro quanto la preservazione degli oceani sia fondamentale (si ricorda il vertice One Ocean, a cui anche l’UE ha preso parte). In attesa della prossima conferenza delle Nazioni Unite sull’oceano prevista per giugno o luglio a Lisbona, l’Unione Europea ha messo a punto un piano per focalizzandosi sulla ricerca, lo sviluppo e l’innovazione nei finanziamenti per avviare un’impresa (i cosiddetti “seed”) destinando 500 milioni di euro tra il 2021-2023 alla missione Horizon Restore our Ocean and Waters.

Centrale nella missione è considerare l’oceano e le acque come un tutt’uno e raggiungere gli obiettivi dell’UE di proteggere il 30 percento dell’area marina degli Stati membri, ripristinando gli ecosistemi marini, prevenendo ed eliminando l’inquinamento, riducendo i rifiuti di plastica in mare, le perdite di nutrienti e l’uso di pesticidi chimici. Ci sarà inoltre un’ottimizzazione del monitoraggio satellitare (Copernicus) per cui l’UE ha investito 55 milioni di euro. Sempre col fine di controllare le transizioni dell’ambiente marino e dei cambiamenti climatici, verrà perfezionato WEkEO, strumento a servizio della comunità di ricerca internazionale che permette di avere accesso a una dettagliata raccolta di dati ambientali mentre offre strumenti online per le scienze ambientali su strutture di cloud computing.

L’Unione europea ha presentato alla conferenza “Il nostro oceano” di Palau un elenco di 44 impegni per il periodo 2020-2022 per un totale di quasi un miliardo di euro, la spesa più cospicua mai annunciata nel corso di una conferenza di questo ciclo.

La conferenza “Il nostro oceano” riunisce i Paesi di tutto il mondo, la società civile e l’industria per cercare di intraprendere azioni concrete per la salvaguardia degli oceani. Nell’edizione 2022 lo scopo era individuare soluzioni per gestire le risorse marine in modo sostenibile, aumentare la resilienza degli oceani ai cambiamenti climatici e tutelarne la salute per le generazioni future.

“Oggi l’Ue ha impegnato una somma significativa, ma è ancora più importante il ruolo degli oceani per la nostra esistenza: ci danno aria pulita, regolano il clima, contengono gran parte della biodiversità della terra e sono fondamentali per l’economia. Dobbiamo proteggerli, ne va del nostro futuro”, ha detto il commissario all’ambiente Virginijus Sinkevičius.

Tra i 44 impegni presi dall’Ue alla conferenza sono inclusi: le aree marine protette; la lotta contro l’inquinamento marino; la battaglia contro le conseguenze della crisi climatica sugli oceani; la creazione di economie sostenibili; la promozione della pesca su piccola scala e dell’acquacoltura sostenibili; la volontà di ottenere oceani sicuri, equi e protetti.

L’Ue ha anche messo a punto uno strumento per il monitoraggio di questi impegni, che consentirà ai cittadini di tenere traccia del loro raggiungimento. L’Europa continua a sostenere iniziative come “One Ocean Summit”, svolto a Brest a febbraio, e la conferenza delle Nazioni Unite sugli oceani di giugno-luglio a Lisbona.

Nel periodo 2021-2023 saranno destinati quasi 500 milioni di euro alla ricerca, sviluppo e innovazione nel campo dei finanziamenti di avviamento per la missione di Horizon Europe “Far rivivere i nostri oceani e le nostre acque entro il 2030”.

Il suo obiettivo sarà quello di protezione del 30% delle aree marine degli Stati membri e di ripristinare gli ecosistemi marini, ridurre i rifiuti in plastica nel mare, l’uso di pesticidi chimici e favorire lo sviluppo dell’economia sostenibile e circolare.

Saranno investiti anche 55 milioni di euro in due anni per rafforzare il controllo dell’ambiente marino e dei cambiamenti climatici, attraverso il programma di osservazione satellitare Copernicus e il servizio WeKeo, che permette di accedere da un’unica piattaforma a tutti i prodotti che descrivono passato, presente e futuro del sistema terrestre.",it,"Palau, Lisbona, Brest","la conferenza delle Nazioni Unite sugli oceani di giugno-luglio, WeKeo, L’Unione europea, Copernicus, L’Europa, Horizon Europe",Virginijus Sinkevičius,"conferenza, oceani, euro, nostro, impegni, l’ue, miliardo, oceano, marine, protezione"

Ecologia

The Ocean Race, il famoso giro del mondo a vela in equipaggio e leader nel settore della sostenibilità, e la Commissione Oceanografica Intergovernativa dell'UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO), stanno unendo le forze per contribuire ad aumentare la comprensione dell'oceano e ispirare azioni per proteggerlo.

La partnership mira a contribuire all'azione globale per l'oceano, in quello che si spera sia un anno significativo per i mari, a partire dal One Ocean Summit di Brest, in Francia, un evento che punta a far crescere l'azione internazionale e spingere verso impegni concreti.

La nuova collaborazione combina la profonda esperienza di The Ocean Race sui mari, che deriva da quasi 50 anni di organizzazione di regate oceaniche, con la leadership del CIO nella scienza marina e nella gestione sostenibile degli oceani. La partnership utilizzerà la piattaforma globale della regata per aumentare la consapevolezza dell'impatto che le persone stanno avendo sull'oceano e il ruolo vitale che gioca nelle nostre vite.

The Ocean Race e il CIO dell'UNESCO uniscono le forze per ispirare la protezione degli oceani

Come Impact Collaborator, il CIO lavorerà con The Ocean Race sul programma scientifico, che raccoglie dati sullo stato dell'ambiente marino, anche in parti remote dell'oceano che sono in gran parte inaccessibili alle navi di ricerca. I partner lavoreranno insieme per garantire che i dati raccolti dagli equipaggi aiutino a far progredire la ricerca oceanica con il sostegno del Decennio delle Nazioni Unite della scienza oceanica per lo sviluppo sostenibile (2021-2030), giunto al secondo anno. I dati contribuiranno al Global Ocean Observing System guidato dal CIO e al lavoro di altre organizzazioni che stanno monitorando le principali minacce all'oceano, come i detriti marini, le microplastiche e l'acidificazione (un indicatore chiave del cambiamento climatico).

Vladimir Ryabinin, segretario esecutivo del CIO-UNESCO, ha dichiarato: ""Creare l'oceano che vogliamo entro il 2030 - un oceano che sia sano, resiliente, sostenibile, sicuro e stimolante - è l'obiettivo centrale del Decennio dell'Oceano delle Nazioni Unite, e fin dall'inizio è stato evidente che abbiamo bisogno di un’ampia collaborazione tra scienza, governo, filantropia e società civile per raggiungerlo. Dal 2015 siamo abbiamo lavorato in partnership con il mondo della vela attraverso la Classe IMOCA, e penso che la nostra nuova partnership con The Ocean Race dimostri il crescente impegno di questa comunità nella comprensione e nella protezione dell'oceano""

Il CIO sarà anche coinvolto nei Summit organizzati da The Ocean Race, che riuniscono i decisori globali per contribuire a guidare politiche nuove e migliori per proteggere e governare l'oceano, e parteciperà ad amplificare il programma educativo di The Ocean Race, che insegna ai bambini l'importanza dei mari. Durante il prossimo giro del mondo, che inizierà nel gennaio 2023, i partner coinvolgeranno i bambini negli otto Race Village (il luogo dell'evento della regata in ogni città sede di tappa), dove la salute dell'oceano sarà un tema centrale.

The Ocean Race e il CIO dell'UNESCO uniscono le forze per ispirare la protezione degli oceani

Richard Brisius, presidente di The Ocean Race ha detto: ""The Ocean Race e IOC-UNESCO condividono l'obiettivo comune di aumentare la consapevolezza del ruolo vitale che gioca l'oceano nel sostenere tutta la vita sulla terra. Solo aumentando la comprensione del nostro pianeta blu possiamo guidare un’azione più incisiva per proteggerlo. Condividiamo gli stessi valori del CIO e combinando la loro esperienza nella scienza oceanica e la nostra piattaforma globale possiamo ispirare il pubblico - come la comunità velica, l'industria sportiva, le imprese, le città ospitanti, i governi, i fan e gli sponsor - ad attuare un cambiamento che supporti un oceano sano e ricco.""

La collaborazione si basa su una maggiore relazione tra le due organizzazioni, che ha già visto Vladimir Ryabinin nel ruolo di speaker al Summit di The Ocean Race all'Aia nel 2020 e il sostegno a molte delle attività di The Ocean Race da parte del Decennio delle Nazioni Unite della Scienza degli Oceani per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile. Il Decennio è un movimento globale che ha l’obiettivo di sbloccare le conoscenze necessarie per invertire il declino della salute degli oceani e creare condizioni migliori per uno sviluppo sostenibile dell'oceano.

Le partnership sono un elemento chiave del pluripremiato programma di sostenibilità ""Racing with Purpose"" di The Ocean Race, che riunisce una serie di azioni tangibili per un impatto positivo sull'ambiente marino. Lavorando con 11th Hour Racing - il partner fondatore del programma Racing with Purpose e Premier Partner di The Ocean Race, The Ocean Race sta tenendo summit di alto livello per spingere i decisori globali a creare politiche per proteggere e governare l'oceano, fornendo dati vitali sullo stato dei mari alle principali organizzazioni scientifiche, dotando i bambini delle conoscenze per salvaguardare l'oceano e molto altro ancora.",it,Francia,"Racing with Purpose, CIO, 11th Hour Racing, il CIO dell'UNESCO uniscono, la Commissione Oceanografica Intergovernativa dell'UNESCO (, l'industria sportiva, CIO-UNESCO, IOC-UNESCO, CIO dell'UNESCO:, al Global Ocean Observing System, The Ocean Race, CIO dell'UNESCO uniscono, la comunità velica","Vladimir Ryabinin, Richard Brisius","ocean, race, cio, dell'unesco, protezione, oceani, partnership, scienza, sostenibile, globale"

La nuova collaborazione combina la profonda esperienza di The Ocean Race sui mari, che deriva da quasi 50 anni di organizzazione di regate oceaniche, con la leadership del CIO nella scienza marina e nella gestione sostenibile degli oceani. La partnership utilizzerà la piattaforma globale della regata per aumentare la consapevolezza dell’impatto che le persone stanno avendo sull’oceano e il ruolo vitale che gioca nelle nostre vite.

Come Impact Collaborator, il CIO lavorerà con The Ocean Race sul programma scientifico, che raccoglie dati sullo stato dell’ambiente marino, anche in parti remote dell’oceano che sono in gran parte inaccessibili alle navi di ricerca. I partner lavoreranno insieme per garantire che i dati raccolti dagli equipaggi aiutino a far progredire la ricerca oceanica con il sostegno del Decennio delle Nazioni Unite della scienza oceanica per lo sviluppo sostenibile (2021-2030), giunto al secondo anno. I dati contribuiranno al Global Ocean Observing System guidato dal CIO e al lavoro di altre organizzazioni che stanno monitorando le principali minacce all’oceano, come i detriti marini, le microplastiche e l’acidificazione (un indicatore chiave del cambiamento climatico).

Vladimir Ryabinin, segretario esecutivo del CIO-UNESCO, ha dichiarato: “Creare l’oceano che vogliamo entro il 2030 – un oceano che sia sano, resiliente, sostenibile, sicuro e stimolante – è l’obiettivo centrale del Decennio dell’Oceano delle Nazioni Unite, e fin dall’inizio è stato evidente che abbiamo bisogno di un’ampia collaborazione tra scienza, governo, filantropia e società civile per raggiungerlo. Dal 2015 siamo abbiamo lavorato in partnership con il mondo della vela attraverso la Classe IMOCA, e penso che la nostra nuova partnership con The Ocean Race dimostri il crescente impegno di questa comunità nella comprensione e nella protezione dell’oceano”.

Il CIO sarà anche coinvolto nei Summit organizzati da The Ocean Race, che riuniscono i decisori globali per contribuire a guidare politiche nuove e migliori per proteggere e governare l’oceano, e parteciperà ad amplificare il programma educativo di The Ocean Race, che insegna ai bambini l’importanza dei mari. Durante il prossimo giro del mondo, che inizierà nel gennaio 2023, i partner coinvolgeranno i bambini negli otto Race Village (il luogo dell’evento della regata in ogni città sede di tappa), dove la salute dell’oceano sarà un tema centrale.

Richard Brisius, presidente di The Ocean Race ha detto: “The Ocean Race e IOC-UNESCO condividono l’obiettivo comune di aumentare la consapevolezza del ruolo vitale che gioca l’oceano nel sostenere tutta la vita sulla terra. Solo aumentando la comprensione del nostro pianeta blu possiamo guidare un’azione più incisiva per proteggerlo. Condividiamo gli stessi valori del CIO e combinando la loro esperienza nella scienza oceanica e la nostra piattaforma globale possiamo ispirare il pubblico – come la comunità velica, l’industria sportiva, le imprese, le città ospitanti, i governi, i fan e gli sponsor – ad attuare un cambiamento che supporti un oceano sano e ricco.”

La collaborazione si basa su una maggiore relazione tra le due organizzazioni, che ha già visto Vladimir Ryabinin nel ruolo di speaker al Summit di The Ocean Race all’Aia nel 2020 e il sostegno a molte delle attività di The Ocean Race da parte del Decennio delle Nazioni Unite della Scienza degli Oceani per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile. Il Decennio è un movimento globale che ha l’obiettivo di sbloccare le conoscenze necessarie per invertire il declino della salute degli oceani e creare condizioni migliori per uno sviluppo sostenibile dell’oceano.

Le partnership sono un elemento chiave del pluripremiato programma di sostenibilità “Racing with Purpose” di The Ocean Race, che riunisce una serie di azioni tangibili per un impatto positivo sull’ambiente marino. Lavorando con 11th Hour Racing – il partner fondatore del programma Racing with Purpose e Premier Partner di The Ocean Race, The Ocean Race sta tenendo summit di alto livello per spingere i decisori globali a creare politiche per proteggere e governare l’oceano, fornendo dati vitali sullo stato dei mari alle principali organizzazioni scientifiche, dotando i bambini delle conoscenze per salvaguardare l’oceano e molto altro ancora.",it,"Francia, Brest","CIO, 11th Hour Racing, CIO-UNESCO, IOC-UNESCO, Impact Collaborator, Decennio dell’Oceano delle Nazioni Unite, The Ocean, al Global Ocean Observing System, la Commissione Oceanografica Intergovernativa dell’UNESCO (, The Ocean Race","Vladimir Ryabinin, Richard Brisius","ocean, race, cio, dell’oceano, partnership, scienza, sostenibile, globale, summit, programma"

Intervenendo al vertice, la Presidente von der Leyen ha annunciato tre iniziative chiave per una cooperazione finalizzata a conservare e rinnovare gli oceani: una nuova coalizione internazionale per proteggere la biodiversità in alto mare, che costituisce il 95 % degli oceani; un progetto informatico su grande scala che consente ai ricercatori di creare simulazioni digitali degli oceani del mondo; e la missione di ricerca dell’UE per far rivivere i nostri oceani e le nostre acque entro il 2030. Queste iniziative si sommano al contributo generale dell’UE presentato durante il vertice dai Commissari Gabriel, Vălean e Sinkevičius, che riguarda tutte le quattro sezioni del vertice.

Intervenendo al vertice “One Ocean Summit”, Ursula von der Leyen, Presidente della Commissione europea, ha dichiarato: “La nostra missione di proteggere gli oceani deve essere ampia quanto la nostra responsabilità condivisa. Ecco perché oggi siamo venuti a Brest per unire le forze e invertire la tendenza. L’Europa, quale potenza marittima, può dare un contributo enorme. Ma è solo insieme che potremo rafforzare la protezione dei nostri oceani e farli brulicare nuovamente di vita.”

Protezione della biodiversità e delle risorse marine

Al vertice odierno, la Presidente von der Leyen ha lanciato la coalizione mossa da grandi ambizioni sulla diversità biologica marina nelle zone non soggette a giurisdizione nazionale . L’iniziativa sottolinea il ruolo dell’UE quale attore di primo piano in materia di conservazione dell’ambiente marino a livello mondiale. Le zone non soggette a giurisdizione nazionale costituiscono il 95 % degli oceani e la loro biodiversità offre inestimabili vantaggi ecologici e socioeconomici al genere umano. Tuttavia, queste vaste aree sono sempre più vulnerabili a minacce quali l’inquinamento, lo sfruttamento eccessivo e gli effetti dei cambiamenti climatici. I negoziati delle Nazioni Unite in corso rappresentano un’opportunità unica, e l’UE sta lavorando a ritmo molto intenso per arrivare ad un accordo nel 2022. La coalizione riunisce tutti i soggetti che, come l’UE e i suoi Stati membri, aspirano a concretizzare un ambizioso trattato delle Nazioni Unite sulla diversità biologica marina nelle zone non soggette a giurisdizione nazionale.

L’UE attua da lunga data una tolleranza zero nei confronti della pesca illegale, non dichiarata e non regolamentata (INN), altra pietra angolare della politica ambiziosa che persegue per la gestione sostenibile delle risorse marine. La pesca INN rappresenta una grave minaccia per gli stock ittici mondiali, portandone alcuni sull’orlo dell’esaurimento. Dal 2010 l’UE ha pertanto attuato una serie di misure volte a prevenire, scoraggiare ed eliminare la pesca INN. Sulla base di tali norme, l’UE collabora con i paesi del mondo intero per promuovere la lotta contro la pesca INN e impedire che i suoi prodotti entrino nel mercato dell’UE. L’UE si avvale inoltre del sostegno dell’Agenzia europea di controllo della pesca (EFCA) per garantire la conformità della propria flotta attraverso leggi applicabili alle autorità di controllo degli Stati membri. Oltre a dare l’esempio, l’UE fornisce anche un sostegno finanziario attraverso programmi regionali che promuovono una pesca sostenibile.

Lotta contro l’inquinamento marino

L’inquinamento, in particolare quello causato dalla plastica, rappresenta una seria minaccia per la salute degli oceani, a livello sia mondiale che europeo, e l’UE si sta adoperando per realizzare l’ideale di un oceano pulito. Nell’affrontare l’inquinamento da plastica, l’UE persegue un duplice obiettivo: ridurre l’inquinamento da plastica e accelerare la transizione verso un’economia circolare. La direttiva sulla plastica monouso, in vigore dal 2021, stabilisce norme per l’eliminazione graduale di molti oggetti di plastica, spesso oggetto di sprechi, e per il recupero degli attrezzi da pesca persi in mare. La legislazione rappresenta una tappa fondamentale verso l’eliminazione dei rifiuti marini nell’UE.

Inoltre, l’UE auspica con convinzione il raggiungimento di un accordo internazionale sulla plastica e sta lavorando alla creazione di un comitato per un accordo mondiale nel contesto dell’Assemblea delle Nazioni Unite per l’ambiente del febbraio di quest’anno. Si tratta dell’unica risposta efficace e a lungo termine al problema mondiale dei rifiuti marini. L’UE sta inoltre sensibilizzando attivamente l’opinione pubblica, dando così slancio alla lotta contro i rifiuti marini. Insieme alle Nazioni Unite e a una serie di organizzazioni della società civile, l’UE organizza #EUBeachCleanup, una campagna mondiale a favore degli oceani in occasione della quale decine di migliaia di volontari si attivano ogni anno per rimuovere i rifiuti dalle spiagge e dalle vie navigabili interne.

Un oceano di soluzioni contro i cambiamenti climatici

Conseguire la neutralità in termini di emissioni di carbonio significa anche attuare una transizione verso un trasporto marittimo a zero emissioni. Questo settore è l’asse portante del commercio mondiale e delle catene di approvvigionamento, ma dipende ancora quasi interamente dai combustibili ad alta intensità di carbonio. La proposta “Fuel-EU Maritime” per i trasporti marittimi introduce una norma sui combustibili che limita l’intensità delle emissioni di gas a effetto serra, mentre il regolamento sull’infrastruttura per i combustibili alternativi mira a fornire infrastrutture energetiche adeguate nei porti, a sostegno dell’obbligo di connettersi alla fornitura di energia elettrica sulla terraferma o di utilizzare tecnologie a zero emissioni quando ci si trova in porto.

L’estensione del sistema di scambio di quote di emissione dell’UE (ETS) al settore marittimo garantirà che le emissioni prodotte dal trasporto marittimo rientrino nei limiti complessivi, oltre a creare un segnale di prezzo per promuovere la decarbonizzazione. L’ambizione dell’UE non si ferma alle frontiere dell’Unione: l’UE conduce infatti i negoziati in seno all’Organizzazione marittima internazionale (IMO) in vista di un accordo sull’obiettivo di trasporti marittimi a emissioni zero entro il 2050. Rendere più ecologici i trasporti marittimi è un obiettivo prioritario dei programmi di finanziamento dell’UE, con 1,5 miliardi di € già investiti nell’ambito del meccanismo per collegare l’Europa e Orizzonte Europa, attraverso, ad esempio, il partenariato per il trasporto per vie navigabili (oltre 500 milioni di €).

Governance degli oceani

Inoltre l’UE attribuisce alla scienza e alla tecnologia un ruolo centrale nella conservazione degli oceani. Le “missioni” sono un nuovo approccio dell’UE per affrontare le sfide sociali più rilevanti, fornendo una massa critica di risorse per la ricerca mirata. La missione “far rivivere i nostri oceani e le nostre acque entro il 2030” intende conferire agli oceani un ruolo centrale nel conseguimento degli obiettivi del Green Deal europeo per il 2030. La missione sosterrà i grandi progetti innovativi (i cosiddetti progetti “faro”) tesi a sviluppare e sperimentare soluzioni per la protezione del 30 % dello spazio marittimo dell’UE, il ripristino degli ecosistemi marini e fluviali, la riduzione del 50 % dei rifiuti di plastica in mare, delle perdite di nutrienti e dell’uso di pesticidi chimici, e per rendere l’economia blu climaticamente neutra e circolare.

Lanciata dalla Presidente von der Leyen nel corso del vertice “One Ocean Summit”, la piattaforma digitale European Digital Twin Ocean sarà sviluppata nell’ambito di tale missione e permetterà all’UE di fare da guida nell’uso delle tecnologie informatiche per la protezione degli oceani. Sulla base di osservazioni, di modelli e dei più recenti progressi tecnologici, l’ambiente informatico della piattaforma Digital Twin Ocean permetterà di esaminare diversi scenari, migliorare la comprensione dell’ambiente marino e fornire un contributo basato sulle conoscenze al processo decisionale. La piattaforma Digital Twin Ocean permetterà un accesso aperto e illimitato ai dati marini, colmerà le lacune in termini di conoscenze e promuoverà l’integrazione delle applicazioni di previsione e modellizzazione esistenti a livello dell’UE.

La ricerca sugli oceani non finisce qui. Abbiamo bisogno anche di un’educazione agli oceani che permetta di ampliare la sensibilità e le conoscenze e di creare opportunità per mettere in pratica le nuove conoscenze acquisite. L’UE è impegnata a promuovere l’educazione agli oceani mediante azioni di sensibilizzazione e investimenti nella ricerca, di cui la coalizione EU4Ocean è un esempio. Questa iniziativa inclusiva dal basso riunisce diversi partner al fine di condividere le conoscenze e migliorare l’educazione agli oceani e la loro gestione sostenibile.

Contesto

Gli oceani sono di fondamentale importanza per le generazioni attuali e future. Dotata del più grande spazio marittimo al mondo, l’UE si assume la responsabilità di proteggerlo; quale principale mercato per i prodotti ittici, l’UE guida gli sforzi volti a preservare le sue risorse; quale economia mondiale di primo piano, l’UE coglie l’opportunità di sviluppare soluzioni sostenibili e circolari incentrate sugli oceani.

Gli sforzi dell’UE per la conservazione degli oceani formano parte integrante del Green Deal europeo, che punta a costruire la prima economia neutra in termini di emissioni di carbonio entro il 2050 e a contrastare la perdita di biodiversità.

Dotata del più grande spazio marittimo al mondo, l'UE si assume la responsabilità di proteggerlo; quale principale mercato per i prodotti ittici, l'UE guida gli sforzi volti a preservare le sue risorse; quale economia mondiale di primo piano, l'UE coglie l'opportunità di sviluppare soluzioni sostenibili e circolari incentrate sugli oceani.



Gli sforzi dell'UE per la conservazione degli oceani formano parte integrante del Green Deal europeo, che punta a costruire la prima economia neutra in termini di emissioni di carbonio entro il 2050 e a contrastare la perdita di biodiversità.

Al vertice odierno, la Presidente von der Leyen ha lanciato la coalizione mossa da grandi ambizioni sulla diversità biologica marina nelle zone non soggette a giurisdizione nazionale . L'iniziativa sottolinea il ruolo dell'UE quale attore di primo piano in materia di conservazione dell'ambiente marino a livello mondiale. Le zone non soggette a giurisdizione nazionale costituiscono il 95 % degli oceani e la loro biodiversità offre inestimabili vantaggi ecologici e socioeconomici al genere umano. Tuttavia, queste vaste aree sono sempre più vulnerabili a minacce quali l'inquinamento, lo sfruttamento eccessivo e gli effetti dei cambiamenti climatici. I negoziati delle Nazioni Unite in corso rappresentano un'opportunità unica, e l'UE sta lavorando a ritmo molto intenso per arrivare ad un accordo nel 2022. La coalizione riunisce tutti i soggetti che, come l'UE e i suoi Stati membri, aspirano a concretizzare un ambizioso trattato delle Nazioni Unite sulla diversità biologica marina nelle zone non soggette a giurisdizione nazionale.L'UE attua da lunga data una tolleranza zero nei confronti della pesca illegale, non dichiarata e non regolamentata (INN), altra pietra angolare della politica ambiziosa che persegue per la gestione sostenibile delle risorse marine. La pesca INN rappresenta una grave minaccia per gli stock ittici mondiali, portandone alcuni sull'orlo dell'esaurimento. Dal 2010 l'UE ha pertanto attuato una serie di misure volte a prevenire, scoraggiare ed eliminare la pesca INN. Sulla base di tali norme, l'UE collabora con i paesi del mondo intero per promuovere la lotta contro la pesca INN e impedire che i suoi prodotti entrino nel mercato dell'UE. L'UE si avvale inoltre del sostegno dell'Agenzia europea di controllo della pesca (EFCA) per garantire la conformità della propria flotta attraverso leggi applicabili alle autorità di controllo degli Stati membri. Oltre a dare l'esempio, l'UE fornisce anche un sostegno finanziario attraverso programmi regionali che promuovono una pesca sostenibile.L'inquinamento, in particolare quello causato dalla plastica, rappresenta una seria minaccia per la salute degli oceani, a livello sia mondiale che europeo, e l'UE si sta adoperando per realizzare l'ideale di un oceano pulito. Nell'affrontare l'inquinamento da plastica, l'UE persegue un duplice obiettivo: ridurre l'inquinamento da plastica e accelerare la transizione verso un'economia circolare. La direttiva sulla plastica monouso, in vigore dal 2021, stabilisce norme per l'eliminazione graduale di molti oggetti di plastica, spesso oggetto di sprechi, e per il recupero degli attrezzi da pesca persi in mare. La legislazione rappresenta una tappa fondamentale verso l'eliminazione dei rifiuti marini nell'UE. Inoltre, l'UE auspica con convinzione il raggiungimento di un accordo internazionale sulla plastica e sta lavorando alla creazione di un comitato per un accordo mondiale nel contesto dell'Assemblea delle Nazioni Unite per l'ambiente del febbraio di quest'anno. Si tratta dell'unica risposta efficace e a lungo termine al problema mondiale dei rifiuti marini. L'UE sta inoltre sensibilizzando attivamente l'opinione pubblica, dando così slancio alla lotta contro i rifiuti marini. Insieme alle Nazioni Unite e a una serie di organizzazioni della società civile, l'UE organizza #EUBeachCleanup, una campagna mondiale a favore degli oceani in occasione della quale decine di migliaia di volontari si attivano ogni anno per rimuovere i rifiuti dalle spiagge e dalle vie navigabili interne.Conseguire la neutralità in termini di emissioni di carbonio significa anche attuare una transizione verso un trasporto marittimo a zero emissioni. Questo settore è l'asse portante del commercio mondiale e delle catene di approvvigionamento, ma dipende ancora quasi interamente dai combustibili ad alta intensità di carbonio. La proposta ""Fuel-EU Maritime"" per i trasporti marittimi introduce una norma sui combustibili che limita l'intensità delle emissioni di gas a effetto serra, mentre il regolamento sull'infrastruttura per i combustibili alternativi mira a fornire infrastrutture energetiche adeguate nei porti, a sostegno dell'obbligo di connettersi alla fornitura di energia elettrica sulla terraferma o di utilizzare tecnologie a zero emissioni quando ci si trova in porto. L'estensione del sistema di scambio di quote di emissione dell'UE (ETS) al settore marittimo garantirà che le emissioni prodotte dal trasporto marittimo rientrino nei limiti complessivi, oltre a creare un segnale di prezzo per promuovere la decarbonizzazione. L'ambizione dell'UE non si ferma alle frontiere dell'Unione: l'UE conduce infatti i negoziati in seno all'Organizzazione marittima internazionale (IMO) in vista di un accordo sull'obiettivo di trasporti marittimi a emissioni zero entro il 2050. Rendere più ecologici i trasporti marittimi è un obiettivo prioritario dei programmi di finanziamento dell'UE, con 1,5 miliardi di  già investiti nell'ambito del meccanismo per collegare l'Europa e Orizzonte Europa, attraverso, ad esempio, il partenariato per il trasporto per vie navigabili (oltre 500 milioni di ).Inoltre l'UE attribuisce alla scienza e alla tecnologia un ruolo centrale nella conservazione degli oceani. Le ""missioni"" sono un nuovo approccio dell'UE per affrontare le sfide sociali più rilevanti, fornendo una massa critica di risorse per la ricerca mirata. La missione far rivivere i nostri oceani e le nostre acque entro il 2030 intende conferire agli oceani un ruolo centrale nel conseguimento degli obiettivi del Green Deal europeo per il 2030. La missione sosterrà i grandi progetti innovativi (i cosiddetti progetti ""faro"") tesi a sviluppare e sperimentare soluzioni per la protezione del 30 % dello spazio marittimo dell'UE, il ripristino degli ecosistemi marini e fluviali, la riduzione del 50 % dei rifiuti di plastica in mare, delle perdite di nutrienti e dell'uso di pesticidi chimici, e per rendere l'economia blu climaticamente neutra e circolare.Lanciata dalla Presidente von der Leyen nel corso del vertice ""One Ocean Summit"", la piattaforma digitale European Digital Twin Ocean sarà sviluppata nell'ambito di tale missione e permetterà all'UE di fare da guida nell'uso delle tecnologie informatiche per la protezione degli oceani.

27 agosto 2022

A fifth effort to pass a global agreement to protect the world’s oceans and marine life has failed.

Talks to pass the UN High Seas Treaty had been ongoing for two weeks in New York, but governments could not agree on the terms.

Despite international waters representing nearly two-thirds of the world’s oceans, only 1.2% is protected.

Environmental campaigners have called it a ""missed opportunity"".

The last international agreement on ocean protection was signed 40 years ago in 1982 – the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Intervenendo al vertice, la Presidente von der Leyen ha annunciato tre iniziative chiave per una cooperazione finalizzata a conservare e rinnovare gli oceani: una nuova coalizione internazionale per proteggere la biodiversità in alto mare, che costituisce il 95 % degli oceani; un progetto informatico su grande scala che consente ai ricercatori di creare simulazioni digitali degli oceani del mondo; e la missione di ricerca dell’UE per far rivivere i nostri oceani e le nostre acque entro il 2030. Queste iniziative si sommano al contributo generale dell’UE presentato durante il vertice dai Commissari Gabriel, Vălean e Sinkevičius, che riguarda tutte le quattro sezioni del vertice.

Intervenendo al vertice “One Ocean Summit”, Ursula von der Leyen, Presidente della Commissione europea, ha dichiarato: “La nostra missione di proteggere gli oceani deve essere ampia quanto la nostra responsabilità condivisa. Ecco perché oggi siamo venuti a Brest per unire le forze e invertire la tendenza. L’Europa, quale potenza marittima, può dare un contributo enorme. Ma è solo insieme che potremo rafforzare la protezione dei nostri oceani e farli brulicare nuovamente di vita.”

Lotta contro l’inquinamento marino

L’inquinamento, in particolare quello causato dalla plastica, rappresenta una seria minaccia per la salute degli oceani, a livello sia mondiale che europeo, e l’UE si sta adoperando per realizzare l’ideale di un oceano pulito. Nell’affrontare l’inquinamento da plastica, l’UE persegue un duplice obiettivo: ridurre l’inquinamento da plastica e accelerare la transizione verso un’economia circolare.

Un oceano di soluzioni contro i cambiamenti climatici

Conseguire la neutralità in termini di emissioni di carbonio significa anche attuare una transizione verso un trasporto marittimo a zero emissioni.

Contesto

Gli oceani sono di fondamentale importanza per le generazioni attuali e future. Dotata del più grande spazio marittimo al mondo, l’UE si assume la responsabilità di proteggerlo; quale principale mercato per i prodotti ittici, l’UE guida gli sforzi volti a preservare le sue risorse; quale economia mondiale di primo piano, l’UE coglie l’opportunità di sviluppare soluzioni sostenibili e circolari incentrate sugli oceani.

Gli sforzi dell’UE per la conservazione degli oceani formano parte integrante del Green Deal europeo, che punta a costruire la prima economia neutra in termini di emissioni di carbonio entro il 2050 e a contrastare la perdita di biodiversità.

Putin ha spiegato l'annullamento dell'assalto all'Azovstal con la volontà di salvare le vite dei soldati russi; e ha assicurato che garantira' la vita e un trattamento dignitoso ai soldati ucraini che si arrendono (Tiscali Notizie)",it,"Mariupol, ROMA, Palau, Roma, Azovstal","L'acciaieria Azovstal, Tiscali Notizie, LaPresse, La Sicilia, Gli Stati Uniti, OOC, Il Fatto Quotidiano, Tass, la società civile e l’industria, Our Ocean, Gazzetta di Parma",Vladimir Putin,"impegni, l’ue, mariupol, euro, oceani, annuncia, protezione, roma, apr, putin"
314,2022-03-22,Torre del Cerrano Marine Protected Area,https://abruzzoturismo.it/en/torre-del-cerrano-marine-protected-area,1,0,0,0,abruzzoturismo.it,Italy,"The Marine Protected Area Torre del Cerrano was established by decree of the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of the Territory and the Sea in the year 2009.

The sea bottom of this body of water is the typical Adriatic sandy one, with some bottom cliffs. In the area there are a good number of marine animal species and a small but large contingent of plant species (Adriatic gastropod, Adriatic trivia, Sabellaria halcocki). In the underwater environment of the protected area it is easy to come across various species of fish and molluscs, such as: congers, sea bass, soles and cargos, living in contact with the sandy bottoms characterized by extensive and important schools of Chamelea gallina (common clam).

The dunes of the Marine Protected Area offer the opportunity to observe many interesting species of insects such as the Scarabeus semipunctatus and the rare Lamprinodes pictus, in addition to unusual and particular bird species.

Here it nests the Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) a rare migratory bird that frequents these Area from late April to September, returning every spring for the laying of its eggs (the name in Italian for this species of bird is “Fratino”).

Among the dune vegetation you can find wonderful specimens of Sea lily (Pancratium maritimum), Gargano Mullein (Verbascum niveum subsp. garganicum), Maritime snowbell (Calystegia soldanella) and Sea spurge (Euphorbia peplis). In the southern area, close to the pine forests, there is also a dense population of the very rare Beach saffron (Romulea rollii).

The pinewood, inhabited by the Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) and the Pine-nut pine, is a unique environment indeed, a continuum between sea and land that creates a particularly favorable microclimate during the summer season, containing elements of high naturalistic value, too.

Underwater, just in front of the tower, there is the ancient port of the city of Hadria (Atri, nowadays), probably of Roman times. More than one researchers state it.

Cerrano Tower is one of the ancient coastal towers of the Kingdom of Naples, located on the Adriatic coast, in the province of Teramo, between the cities of Silvi and Pineto. It is part of the dense network of coastal fortifications of the Kingdom of Naples, remained intact to nowadays. These watchtowers were there in order to repel the frequent attacks from the sea by Turks and Saracens. It houses the International Veterinary Training Center as well as the Library and the Museum of the Sea.

The European Union recognizes the Marine Protected Area Torre del Cerrano as one of the Sites of Community interest, part of the Natura 2000 network. Sand banks with a weak water coverage, characteristic element of a large part of the Adriatic coast - with cliffs that stand out for Sabellaria bio-constructions (an environmental indicator) - and coastal dunes with fauna and vegetation species of primary interest: these are the environments recognized as ""priority habitats"" to be protected.

Quest’anno ricorre il 52o anniversario della Giornata della Terra che è stata celebrata per la prima volta nel 1970. Mary Kay Inc. si unisce alla celebrazione dell’ambiente e di tutti i partenariati a livello globale volti a promuovere l’investimento nel pianeta e il conseguimento dei 17 Obiettivi di sviluppo sostenibile (OSS) delineati dall’Organizzazione delle Nazioni Unite (ONU).

Gli interventi per la protezione degli oceani costituiscono una premessa imprescindibile ai fini del successo della lotta contro il cambiamento climatico e della concretizzazione degli OSS. Gli oceani ricoprono il 70% della superficie terrestre, rappresentano la biosfera più estesa del pianeta e ospitano l’80% di tutte le forme di vita. Generano il 50% dell’ossigeno di cui abbiamo bisogno, assorbono il 25% di tutte le emissioni di anidride carbonica e catturano il 90% del calore aggiuntivo generato da tali emissioni.1

The Nature Conservancy (TNC) ha intrapreso una missione per proteggere i nostri oceani con il sostegno di Mary Kay, la cui strategia per la sostenibilità è imperniata per l’appunto sulle risorse idriche: “In questa Giornata della Terra, gli oceani hanno bisogno di tutti noi”, ha dichiarato Jeffrey Parrish, direttore generale globale della divisione Protezione della natura presso The Nature Conservancy. “Con il sostegno dei suoi partner aziendali, TNC si sta adoperando ogni giorno in tutto il mondo per preservare le barriere coralline, le zone costiere e le zone di pesca che rendono prospere la vita su questo pianeta e le nostre stesse vite. Insieme, rendiamo ogni giornata una Giornata della Terra.”

Attraverso la nostra partnership Mary Kay sostiene progetti che producono un impatto sostenibile ai fini della preservazione e della protezione dei nostri oceani:

Protezione degli oceani a livello globale per migliorare la salute degli oceani per la natura e le persone;

Protezione delle barriere coralline resilienti al cambiamento climatico, i cosiddetti “super coralli”, nel Triangolo dei Coralli;

Ripristino delle scogliere di molluschi della regione Asia Pacifico in Australia, Hong Kong e Cina;

Sostegno delle donne leader nella regione del Pacifico nella Papua Nuova Guinea (mangrovie, donne e mercati) e nelle Isole Salomone (salute e resilienza collettive);

Conservazione e ripristino delle zone costiere lungo la Costa del Golfo (protezione delle zone umide costiere lungo la Costa del Golfo);

Miglioramento della aziende ittiche in Messico (miglioramento delle aziende ittiche ed emancipazione collettiva).

The Nature Conservancy formerà una nuova partnership globale per identificare e proteggere le barriere coralline in grado di sopravvivere ai cambiamenti climatici, i cosiddetti “super coralli” in occasione della Conferenza sugli oceani delle Nazioni Unite del 2022 che avrà luogo a Lisbona in Portogallo. La Conferenza sugli oceani delle Nazioni Unite, ospitata congiuntamente dai governi del Kenya e del Portogallo, verterà su questioni riguardanti le minacce alla salute, l’ecologia, l’economia e la governance degli oceani, oltre a sollecitare l’adozione di soluzioni innovative basate su fondamenti scientifici per aprire le porte a una nuova era di azione globale volta alla protezione degli oceani.

“Non solo nella Giornata della Terra, ma ogni singolo giorno, Mary Kay celebra ciò che abbiamo fatto per investire nel nostro pianeta e proteggere i nostri oceani: una fonte di sostentamento per circa 3 miliardi di persone a livello mondiale. È fondamentale per la nostra terra, per il nostro futuro e per la collettività. Mary Kay è orgogliosa delle partnership che ha instaurato per contribuire a generare un impatto sostenibile e duraturo a favore di comunità in tutto il mondo. Si tratta, di fatto, di una partnership per il pianeta” ha dichiarato Deborah Gibbins, direttrice operativa presso Mary Kay.

“Sappiamo che rimane ancora molto da fare, ma sappiamo anche che possiamo fare di più e lo faremo. Prendersi cura della nostro pianeta è importante per Mary Kay e la Giornata della Terra ci offre un’opportunità per rinnovare i nostri impegni di implementazione di interventi sostenibili”, ha aggiunto Gibbins.

317,2022-02-13,The Ocean Race e il CIO dell’UNESCO uniscono le forze per ispirare la protezione degli oceani | Velaveneta.it,https://www.velaveneta.it/2022/02/13/the-ocean-race-e-il-cio-dellunesco-uniscono-le-forze-per-ispirare-la-protezione-degli-oceani/,1,0,1,0,velaveneta.it,Italy,"The Ocean Race, il famoso giro del mondo a vela in equipaggio e leader nel settore della sostenibilità, e la Commissione Oceanografica Intergovernativa dell’UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO), stanno unendo le forze per contribuire ad aumentare la comprensione dell’oceano e ispirare azioni per proteggerlo.

La partnership mira a contribuire all’azione globale per l’oceano, in quello che si spera sia un anno significativo per i mari, a partire dal One Ocean Summit di Brest, in Francia, un evento che punta a far crescere l’azione internazionale e spingere verso impegni concreti.

La nuova collaborazione combina la profonda esperienza di The Ocean Race sui mari, che deriva da quasi 50 anni di organizzazione di regate oceaniche, con la leadership del CIO nella scienza marina e nella gestione sostenibile degli oceani. La partnership utilizzerà la piattaforma globale della regata per aumentare la consapevolezza dell’impatto che le persone stanno avendo sull’oceano e il ruolo vitale che gioca nelle nostre vite.

Come Impact Collaborator, il CIO lavorerà con The Ocean Race sul programma scientifico, che raccoglie dati sullo stato dell’ambiente marino, anche in parti remote dell’oceano che sono in gran parte inaccessibili alle navi di ricerca. I partner lavoreranno insieme per garantire che i dati raccolti dagli equipaggi aiutino a far progredire la ricerca oceanica con il sostegno del Decennio delle Nazioni Unite della scienza oceanica per lo sviluppo sostenibile (2021-2030), giunto al secondo anno. I dati contribuiranno al Global Ocean Observing System guidato dal CIO e al lavoro di altre organizzazioni che stanno monitorando le principali minacce all’oceano, come i detriti marini, le microplastiche e l’acidificazione (un indicatore chiave del cambiamento climatico).

Vladimir Ryabinin, segretario esecutivo del CIO-UNESCO, ha dichiarato: “Creare l’oceano che vogliamo entro il 2030 – un oceano che sia sano, resiliente, sostenibile, sicuro e stimolante – è l’obiettivo centrale del Decennio dell’Oceano delle Nazioni Unite, e fin dall’inizio è stato evidente che abbiamo bisogno di un’ampia collaborazione tra scienza, governo, filantropia e società civile per raggiungerlo. Dal 2015 siamo abbiamo lavorato in partnership con il mondo della vela attraverso la Classe IMOCA, e penso che la nostra nuova partnership con The Ocean Race dimostri il crescente impegno di questa comunità nella comprensione e nella protezione dell’oceano”.

Il CIO sarà anche coinvolto nei Summit organizzati da The Ocean Race, che riuniscono i decisori globali per contribuire a guidare politiche nuove e migliori per proteggere e governare l’oceano, e parteciperà ad amplificare il programma educativo di The Ocean Race, che insegna ai bambini l’importanza dei mari. Durante il prossimo giro del mondo, che inizierà nel gennaio 2023, i partner coinvolgeranno i bambini negli otto Race Village (il luogo dell’evento della regata in ogni città sede di tappa), dove la salute dell’oceano sarà un tema centrale.

Richard Brisius, presidente di The Ocean Race ha detto: “The Ocean Race e IOC-UNESCO condividono l’obiettivo comune di aumentare la consapevolezza del ruolo vitale che gioca l’oceano nel sostenere tutta la vita sulla terra. Solo aumentando la comprensione del nostro pianeta blu possiamo guidare un’azione più incisiva per proteggerlo. Condividiamo gli stessi valori del CIO e combinando la loro esperienza nella scienza oceanica e la nostra piattaforma globale possiamo ispirare il pubblico – come la comunità velica, l’industria sportiva, le imprese, le città ospitanti, i governi, i fan e gli sponsor – ad attuare un cambiamento che supporti un oceano sano e ricco.”

La collaborazione si basa su una maggiore relazione tra le due organizzazioni, che ha già visto Vladimir Ryabinin nel ruolo di speaker al Summit di The Ocean Race all’Aia nel 2020 e il sostegno a molte delle attività di The Ocean Race da parte del Decennio delle Nazioni Unite della Scienza degli Oceani per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile. Il Decennio è un movimento globale che ha l’obiettivo di sbloccare le conoscenze necessarie per invertire il declino della salute degli oceani e creare condizioni migliori per uno sviluppo sostenibile dell’oceano.

Le partnership sono un elemento chiave del pluripremiato programma di sostenibilità “Racing with Purpose” di The Ocean Race, che riunisce una serie di azioni tangibili per un impatto positivo sull’ambiente marino. Lavorando con 11th Hour Racing – il partner fondatore del programma Racing with Purpose e Premier Partner di The Ocean Race, The Ocean Race sta tenendo summit di alto livello per spingere i decisori globali a creare politiche per proteggere e governare l’oceano, fornendo dati vitali sullo stato dei mari alle principali organizzazioni scientifiche, dotando i bambini delle conoscenze per salvaguardare l’oceano e molto altro ancora.",it,Francia,"Racing with Purpose, CIO, 11th Hour Racing, CIO-UNESCO, IOC-UNESCO, Impact Collaborator, Decennio dell’Oceano delle Nazioni Unite, al Global Ocean Observing System, The Ocean, la Commissione Oceanografica Intergovernativa dell’UNESCO (, CIO dell’UNESCO, The Ocean Race, Summit","Vladimir Ryabinin, Richard Brisius","ocean, race, cio, partnership, scienza, sostenibile, dell’oceano, globale, summit, programma"

Chef e professionisti dell’Accoglienza si affacceranno al mondo del lavoro con consapevolezza e rispetto per l’ambiente e per le comunità, in coerenza con gli obiettivi dell’Agenda 2030.

I rappresentanti del Consorzio di Gestione di Torre Guaceto, Slow Food Puglia e dell’Istituto Alberghiero Sandro Pertini di Brindisi con sede associata a Carovigno hanno sottoscritto un protocollo di intesa attraverso il quale realizzeranno corsi di formazione rivolti a studenti, docenti, personale ATA, esperti o cultori delle diverse discipline di settore con focus sull’educazione ambientale, alimentare e sulla gestione virtuosa delle risorse naturali, valoriali dell’Accoglienza e del Turismo territoriale.

Attraverso stage e iniziative di orientamento al lavoro, i percorsi formativi della scuola avranno una forte impronta “green” di sviluppo sul campo agroalimentare/enogastronomico e turistico di competenze in materia di biodiversità e alimentazione sostenibile.

“I nostri ragazzi - ha commentato Rocky Malatesta, Presidente del Consorzio Torre Guaceto - saranno i primi ambasciatori della sostenibilità sia nell’ambito dell’offerta turistica locale, sia fuori. Ringrazio Slow Food e l’Istituto Alberghiero per aver sposato la nostra causa. Presto arriveremo tra i banchi della scuola brindisina e della sua sede carovignese”.

Le competenze dell’Istituto Alberghiero e dei partner saranno condivise a beneficio dell’intera comunità attraverso eventi aggregativi di educazione all’ambiente, all’alimentazione sostenibile e di accompagnamento al lavoro in ambito enogastronomico e turistico-ricettivo.

“E’ nel senso dell’ Educazione Civica e Sostenibile all’Ambiente e all’Alimentazione, il patto formativo siglato”, secondo il Dirigente Scolastico IPEOA BR Cosimo Marcello Castellano. “Trattasi di un progetto pionieristico di alleanza con il Consorzio dell’ Area Marina Protetta di Torre Guaceto e Slow Food Puglia per educare e formare anche alle professionalità emergenti in nicchie di qualità “green” come il BioBar, Turismo Slow e Alimentazione Sostenibile”.

Negli intenti di Slow Food, la rete del “buono, pulito e giusto” nasce da lontano e punta ad elevare il livello di sostenibilità ambientale, energetica e sociale dell’intero territorio. “Slow Food Puglia è da sempre al fianco della riserva - ha dichiarato Marcello Longo, Presidente dell’Associazione - tanti i progetti che abbiamo realizzato nel tempo e tanti quelli che realizzeremo in futuro. Ora grazie all’Istituto Alberghiero Sandro Pertini di Brindisi possiamo intervenire sulla formazione della nuova generazione di cuochi e operatori dell’accoglienza, non potevamo chiedere di meglio. Faremo cultura gastronomica sostenibile e ambientale per tutti”.

321,2022-04-14,Dall'UE 1 miliardo di euro in impegni per la protezione degli oceani - Eunews,https://www.eunews.it/2022/04/14/dallue-1-miliardo-di-euro-in-impegni-per-la-protezione-degli-oceani/,0,0,0,0,eunews.it,Italy,"Bruxelles – Dalla lotta contro l’inquinamento marino alla creazione di economie blu sostenibili, passando per la promozione della pesca e dell’acquacoltura con meno impatto ambientale sul territorio. Sono 44 gli impegni per il periodo 2020-2022 che l’Unione Europea si è impegnata oggi (14 aprile) a realizzare in occasione della conferenza internazionale “Il nostro oceano” a Palau (Oceania), mobilitando circa un miliardo di euro in favore della causa.

Secondo Bruxelles si tratta dell’impegno finanziario “più cospicuo” mobilitato fino a questo momento per l’economia blu, spiega l’Esecutivo europeo in una nota. L’edizione 2022 della conferenza ha per tema “Il nostro oceano, il nostro popolo, la nostra prosperità” (Our Ocean, Our People, Our Prosperity) e invita i partner di tutto il mondo a individuare soluzioni per gestire le risorse marine in modo sostenibile, aumentare la resilienza degli oceani ai cambiamenti climatici e tutelarne la salute per le generazioni future. E’ in questo contesto che Bruxelles ha messo a punto anche un nuovo strumento di monitoraggio per consentire ai cittadini di seguire i progressi nell’attuazione degli impegni.

“Oggi l’UE ha impegnato una somma importante, ma ancora più importante è il ruolo degli oceani per la nostra stessa esistenza: ci danno aria pulita, regolano il clima, contengono gran parte della biodiversità della Terra e sono fondamentali per l’economia”, ha commentato il commissario europeo per l’ambiente e gli oceani Virginiius Sinkevičius. “Gli oceani ci offrono tutti questi benefici e per questo dobbiamo proteggerli. Ne va del nostro futuro”.

Rispetto alla sola protezione degli oceani, più ampio è il concetto di economia blu, che comprende tutte le industrie e i settori legati agli oceani, ai mari e alle coste, sia dell’ambiente marino (navigazione, pesca, produzione di energia) che terrestre (porti, cantieri navali, acquacoltura terrestre e produzione di alghe, turismo costiero), che secondo le stime della Commissione oggi dà lavoro a 4,5 milioni di persone e fattura 650 miliardi di euro l’anno. A maggio dello scorso anno la Commissione Europea ha presentato il suo piano d’azione per “un nuovo approccio per un’economia blu sostenibile nell’UE: Trasformare l’economia blu dell’UE per un futuro sostenibile”, per rendere l’economia blu più vicina agli obiettivi del Green Deal europeo.",it,"Palau, Bruxelles","la Commissione Europea, Bruxelles, Eunews, l’Unione Europea",Virginiius Sinkevičius,"blu, nostro, l’economia, euro, bruxelles, europeo, sostenibile, miliardo, protezione, marino"

Nell’ambito del contributo dell’UE al vertice “One Ocean Summit” organizzato dalla Francia a Brest, la Commissione presenta oggi una serie di iniziative ambiziose per promuovere oceani più puliti, più sani e più sicuri e dà prova del ruolo guida dell’UE nel fornire una risposta globale alle sfide riguardanti gli oceani. Intervenendo al vertice, la Presidente von der Leyen ha annunciato tre iniziative chiave per una cooperazione finalizzata a conservare e rinnovare gli oceani: una nuova coalizione internazionale per proteggere la biodiversità in alto mare, che costituisce il 95 % degli oceani; un progetto informatico su grande scala che consente ai ricercatori di creare simulazioni digitali degli oceani del mondo; e la missione di ricerca dell’UE per far rivivere i nostri oceani e le nostre acque entro il 2030. Queste iniziative si sommano al contributo generale dell’UE presentato durante il vertice dai Commissari Gabriel, Vălean e Sinkevičius, che riguarda tutte le quattro sezioni del vertice.

Intervenendo al vertice “One Ocean Summit”, Ursula von der Leyen, Presidente della Commissione europea, ha dichiarato: “La nostra missione di proteggere gli oceani deve essere ampia quanto la nostra responsabilità condivisa. Ecco perché oggi siamo venuti a Brest per unire le forze e invertire la tendenza. L’Europa, quale potenza marittima, può dare un contributo enorme. Ma è solo insieme che potremo rafforzare la protezione dei nostri oceani e farli brulicare nuovamente di vita.”

Protezione della biodiversità e delle risorse marine

Al vertice odierno, la Presidente von der Leyen ha lanciato la coalizione mossa da grandi ambizioni sulla diversità biologica marina nelle zone non soggette a giurisdizione nazionale . L’iniziativa sottolinea il ruolo dell’UE quale attore di primo piano in materia di conservazione dell’ambiente marino a livello mondiale. Le zone non soggette a giurisdizione nazionale costituiscono il 95 % degli oceani e la loro biodiversità offre inestimabili vantaggi ecologici e socioeconomici al genere umano. Tuttavia, queste vaste aree sono sempre più vulnerabili a minacce quali l’inquinamento, lo sfruttamento eccessivo e gli effetti dei cambiamenti climatici. I negoziati delle Nazioni Unite in corso rappresentano un’opportunità unica, e l’UE sta lavorando a ritmo molto intenso per arrivare ad un accordo nel 2022. La coalizione riunisce tutti i soggetti che, come l’UE e i suoi Stati membri, aspirano a concretizzare un ambizioso trattato delle Nazioni Unite sulla diversità biologica marina nelle zone non soggette a giurisdizione nazionale.

L’UE attua da lunga data una tolleranza zero nei confronti della pesca illegale, non dichiarata e non regolamentata (INN), altra pietra angolare della politica ambiziosa che persegue per la gestione sostenibile delle risorse marine. La pesca INN rappresenta una grave minaccia per gli stock ittici mondiali, portandone alcuni sull’orlo dell’esaurimento. Dal 2010 l’UE ha pertanto attuato una serie di misure volte a prevenire, scoraggiare ed eliminare la pesca INN. Sulla base di tali norme, l’UE collabora con i paesi del mondo intero per promuovere la lotta contro la pesca INN e impedire che i suoi prodotti entrino nel mercato dell’UE. L’UE si avvale inoltre del sostegno dell’Agenzia europea di controllo della pesca (EFCA) per garantire la conformità della propria flotta attraverso leggi applicabili alle autorità di controllo degli Stati membri. Oltre a dare l’esempio, l’UE fornisce anche un sostegno finanziario attraverso programmi regionali che promuovono una pesca sostenibile.

Lotta contro l’inquinamento marino

L’inquinamento, in particolare quello causato dalla plastica, rappresenta una seria minaccia per la salute degli oceani, a livello sia mondiale che europeo, e l’UE si sta adoperando per realizzare l’ideale di un oceano pulito. Nell’affrontare l’inquinamento da plastica, l’UE persegue un duplice obiettivo: ridurre l’inquinamento da plastica e accelerare la transizione verso un’economia circolare. La direttiva sulla plastica monouso, in vigore dal 2021, stabilisce norme per l’eliminazione graduale di molti oggetti di plastica, spesso oggetto di sprechi, e per il recupero degli attrezzi da pesca persi in mare. La legislazione rappresenta una tappa fondamentale verso l’eliminazione dei rifiuti marini nell’UE. Inoltre, l’UE auspica con convinzione il raggiungimento di un accordo internazionale sulla plastica e sta lavorando alla creazione di un comitato per un accordo mondiale nel contesto dell’Assemblea delle Nazioni Unite per l’ambiente del febbraio di quest’anno. Si tratta dell’unica risposta efficace e a lungo termine al problema mondiale dei rifiuti marini. L’UE sta inoltre sensibilizzando attivamente l’opinione pubblica, dando così slancio alla lotta contro i rifiuti marini. Insieme alle Nazioni Unite e a una serie di organizzazioni della società civile, l’UE organizza #EUBeachCleanup, una campagna mondiale a favore degli oceani in occasione della quale decine di migliaia di volontari si attivano ogni anno per rimuovere i rifiuti dalle spiagge e dalle vie navigabili interne.

Un oceano di soluzioni contro i cambiamenti climatici

Conseguire la neutralità in termini di emissioni di carbonio significa anche attuare una transizione verso un trasporto marittimo a zero emissioni. Questo settore è l’asse portante del commercio mondiale e delle catene di approvvigionamento, ma dipende ancora quasi interamente dai combustibili ad alta intensità di carbonio. La proposta “Fuel-EU Maritime” per i trasporti marittimi introduce una norma sui combustibili che limita l’intensità delle emissioni di gas a effetto serra, mentre il regolamento sull’infrastruttura per i combustibili alternativi mira a fornire infrastrutture energetiche adeguate nei porti, a sostegno dell’obbligo di connettersi alla fornitura di energia elettrica sulla terraferma o di utilizzare tecnologie a zero emissioni quando ci si trova in porto. L’estensione del sistema di scambio di quote di emissione dell’UE (ETS) al settore marittimo garantirà che le emissioni prodotte dal trasporto marittimo rientrino nei limiti complessivi, oltre a creare un segnale di prezzo per promuovere la decarbonizzazione. L’ambizione dell’UE non si ferma alle frontiere dell’Unione: l’UE conduce infatti i negoziati in seno all’Organizzazione marittima internazionale (IMO) in vista di un accordo sull’obiettivo di trasporti marittimi a emissioni zero entro il 2050. Rendere più ecologici i trasporti marittimi è un obiettivo prioritario dei programmi di finanziamento dell’UE, con 1,5 miliardi di € già investiti nell’ambito del meccanismo per collegare l’Europa e Orizzonte Europa, attraverso, ad esempio, il partenariato per il trasporto per vie navigabili (oltre 500 milioni di €).

Governance degli oceani

Inoltre l’UE attribuisce alla scienza e alla tecnologia un ruolo centrale nella conservazione degli oceani. Le “missioni” sono un nuovo approccio dell’UE per affrontare le sfide sociali più rilevanti, fornendo una massa critica di risorse per la ricerca mirata. La missione “far rivivere i nostri oceani e le nostre acque entro il 2030” intende conferire agli oceani un ruolo centrale nel conseguimento degli obiettivi del Green Deal europeo per il 2030. La missione sosterrà i grandi progetti innovativi (i cosiddetti progetti “faro”) tesi a sviluppare e sperimentare soluzioni per la protezione del 30 % dello spazio marittimo dell’UE, il ripristino degli ecosistemi marini e fluviali, la riduzione del 50 % dei rifiuti di plastica in mare, delle perdite di nutrienti e dell’uso di pesticidi chimici, e per rendere l’economia blu climaticamente neutra e circolare.

Lanciata dalla Presidente von der Leyen nel corso del vertice “One Ocean Summit”, la piattaforma digitale European Digital Twin Ocean sarà sviluppata nell’ambito di tale missione e permetterà all’UE di fare da guida nell’uso delle tecnologie informatiche per la protezione degli oceani. Sulla base di osservazioni, di modelli e dei più recenti progressi tecnologici, l’ambiente informatico della piattaforma Digital Twin Ocean permetterà di esaminare diversi scenari, migliorare la comprensione dell’ambiente marino e fornire un contributo basato sulle conoscenze al processo decisionale. La piattaforma Digital Twin Ocean permetterà un accesso aperto e illimitato ai dati marini, colmerà le lacune in termini di conoscenze e promuoverà l’integrazione delle applicazioni di previsione e modellizzazione esistenti a livello dell’UE.

La ricerca sugli oceani non finisce qui. Abbiamo bisogno anche di un’educazione agli oceani che permetta di ampliare la sensibilità e le conoscenze e di creare opportunità per mettere in pratica le nuove conoscenze acquisite. L’UE è impegnata a promuovere l’educazione agli oceani mediante azioni di sensibilizzazione e investimenti nella ricerca, di cui la coalizione EU4Ocean è un esempio. Questa iniziativa inclusiva dal basso riunisce diversi partner al fine di condividere le conoscenze e migliorare l’educazione agli oceani e la loro gestione sostenibile.

Contesto

Gli oceani sono di fondamentale importanza per le generazioni attuali e future. Dotata del più grande spazio marittimo al mondo, l’UE si assume la responsabilità di proteggerlo; quale principale mercato per i prodotti ittici, l’UE guida gli sforzi volti a preservare le sue risorse; quale economia mondiale di primo piano, l’UE coglie l’opportunità di sviluppare soluzioni sostenibili e circolari incentrate sugli oceani.

Gli sforzi dell’UE per la conservazione degli oceani formano parte integrante del Green Deal europeo, che punta a costruire la prima economia neutra in termini di emissioni di carbonio entro il 2050 e a contrastare la perdita di biodiversità.

Aquatic lives threatened by plastic waste are already decade-old news but with the presence of microplastics detected within human blood, it should be obvious enough to say that the issue needs to be tackled and controlled as soon as possible. That’s why Jabra is going to engage in marine conservation at the size of 62,000 football fields, or 450km² for the metric freaks. The engagement will be executed via fund donation towards parties that involve in protecting critical species and the livelihoods of people in Asia-

Pacific who depend on the ocean.

Jabra also recapped what they have done in 2021 for sustaining the overall ecosystem which included:

4,777 tons of e-waste recycled Reduce the carbon footprint of Jabra products in terms of product packaging, distribution, and disposal Upheld the act of human rights safeguards to comply with the UN Principles of Responsible Business Excluded conflict minerals from mining in military-controlled regions via the five-step due diligence guidance laid out by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

And logically speaking, the brand will be continuing to do so for this year as well in addition to tackling the ocean plastic problem so kudos to them for setting an example for other competitors to learn and follow suit.

A delegation from the Maldives, led by Maldives Minister of Environment, Climate Change, and Technology Aminath Shauna, attended the conference to encourage other leaders to take action for the ocean and reaffirm the nation’s commitment to marine protection.

Minister Aminath Shauna emphasized on the commitment by the Maldives to the ocean while addressing leaders from around the globe at the interactive dialogue 5 entitled ""promoting and strengthening sustainable ocean-based economies, in particular for Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries"" at the UNOC.

As such, the Minister stated that the country support the global initiative to protect 30 percent of the world’s oceans and are working to protect at least 20 percent of the country's economic zone. She however noted that Maldives alone cannot achieve this no matter how ambitious the actions are.

Minister Shauna further noted the need for sustainable fishery to be the norm, not the outlier. She stated that what the country needs is development that incorporates ocean protection and climate resilience.

The Minister also recognized that protection extends beyond just environmental conservation and acknowledged the Noo Raajje program’s efforts to plan for the future of the ocean. She expressed hope to protect at least 20 percent and said the country is developing a Marine Spatial Plan with scientific knowledge.

Stating that protection is not just about environmental protection, Minister Shauna stated that it is the way we shape our economic future in a sustainable manner. She stated that it is how we create jobs and income for our people.

This reaffirms President Ibrahim Solih’s commitment to protecting at least 20 percent of the ocean at the United Nations General Assembly in 2019.

This declaration acted as the basis for the Noo Raajje program, a partnership between the Government of the Maldives and the Blue Prosperity Coalition to build a brighter future for all Maldivians through sustainable fisheries practices, Blue Economy development, marine spatial planning and ocean protection, to achieve sustainable ocean management.

Noo Raajje is a partnership between the Government of the Maldives and the Blue Prosperity Coalition to protect the ocean and its resources in order to build a bright future for communities, the economy, and the environment.

Furthermore, the Minister also recognized that protection extends beyond just environmental conservation. The life of every Maldivian is intricately bound to the ocean, especially as the Maldives’ rich ocean biodiversity powers the economy, contributing to over two-thirds of employment and 60% of the GDP. The oceans are an asset to the Maldives, attracting visitors worldwide and sustains the Maldives’ tourism industry.

She will raise awareness through a series of episodes about her adventures.

Several beach clean-ups will be organised together with other dive clean-ups around beaches in Malta and Gozo with the participation of government entities, voluntary organisations and private companies.

Environment Minister Miriam Dalli urged the public to do their part by opting for alternative products and participating in the clean-ups.

Statistics show that the most common waste items collected in local beach clean-ups are cigarette butts, plastic bottles, spoons, straws, bottle caps and cups.

Many hoped the latest round of negotiations would deliver a legally binding international agreement to conserve and protect marine biodiversity on the high seas. The treaty has been more than a decade in the making.

Negotiations concerning the UN High Seas Treaty have been ongoing for two weeks in New York, however, the governments could not agree on the terms. Environmental campaigners have described it as a “missed opportunity”.

While international waters represent nearly two-thirds of the world’s oceans, only 1.2% is protected. Marine life living outside of the 1.2% of protected areas are at risk of exploitation from increasing threats of climate change, overfishing and shipping traffic.

The last international agreement on ocean protection was signed 40 years ago in 1982 – the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.

That agreement established an area called the high seas – international waters where all countries have a right to fish, ship and do research.

Over the last two weeks 168 members of the original treaty, including the European Union, came together to draft a new agreement.

The negotiations focused on four key areas: establishing marine protected areas, improving environmental impact assessments, providing finance and capacity building to developing countries, and sharing of marine genetic resources that can have benefits for society.",en,New York,the European Union,,"agreement, marine, treaty, international, negotiations, high, seas, areas, fifth, effort"

Sobre la minería submarina, el secretario de Estado de Medio Ambiente de España, Hugo Morán, resalta que ""en último término la explotación de recursos mineros submarinos más allá de las aguas jurisdiccionales nacionales corresponde a Naciones Unidas porque se entiende que son recursos que pertenecen al conjunto de la humanidad""

La posición española al respecto, añade, se basa en la ""aplicación del principio de precaución, de manera que no se avance en autorizaciones de explotación de minería submarina en tanto no haya un conocimiento suficiente en relación con las garantías de que no vayan a producirse efectos ambientales irreversibles en el medio marino"".

Acerca de este mismo asunto, desde la organización Ecologistas en Acción explican que la Convención del Derecho al Mar, que es la que regula todo el funcionamiento de la alta autoridad y demás temas relacionados con el océano, prevé que, si no hay acuerdo sobre las normas de explotación del fondo marino, se aplicará ""la norma de los dos años"", que autoriza a países que tienen licencia a iniciar actividades de minería submarina.

Ebrard destacó que para la segunda Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre Océanos, a celebrarse el próximo 27 de junio en Lisboa, “el mensaje desde América, y específicamente de los países que aquí estamos, es que esto lo pueden hacer todos los demás países del mundo”.

Antes de firmar el convenio, el canciller mexicano confió en que se provocara una ola expansiva que comprometerá a otras naciones. “Entonces, lo firmamos, no solo con mucho gusto, sino con todo compromiso”.

Cabe destacar que esta mañana el presidente López Obrador declaró que la delegación que representa a México en la Cumbre de las Américas participa “bajo protesta”.

“Nosotros estamos representados, pero al mismo tiempo lo hacemos bajo protesta, porque no aceptamos que se excluya a nadie.”, dijo el mandatario federal.

Le Maroc est totalement engagé auprès de la communauté internationale pour faire face aux défis liés à la protection des océans, à la préservation de la biodiversité et aux changements climatiques, a affirmé, lundi à Lisbonne, le ministre de l’Agriculture, de la Pêche maritime, du Développement rural et des Eaux et Forêts, Mohamed Sadiki.

Cet engagement se confirme à travers l’adhésion du Royaume et sa ratification des instruments juridiques pertinents au milieu marin et son action constante pour le renforcement des cadres collaboratifs qui en découlent, a précisé M. Sadiki dans son allocution lors de la plénière d’ouverture de la Conférence des Nations Unies sur les Océans, qui se tient du 27 juin au 1er juillet 2022 dans la capitale portugaise, indique le ministère dans un communiqué.

“Fort de l’expérience réussie de plusieurs stratégies sectorielles, dont la stratégie Halieutis pour le développement du secteur halieutique lancée en 2009 et d’une recherche océanographique renforcée permettant une réelle surveillance océanographique et halieutique, le Maroc s’est engagé dans un programme ambitieux de développement de l’économie bleue, visant le renforcement de l’intégration de ses stratégies sectorielles maritimes autour d’une vision écosystémique inclusive, performante et innovante”, a soutenu le ministre.

Et en vue d’assurer un équilibre dans la gestion de son espace maritime, a poursuivi M. Sadiki, le Maroc a engagé un processus de planification spatiale maritime, visant l’accélération de l’émergence de véritables écosystèmes économiques maritimes en phase avec la politique nationale de régionalisation avancée qui érige le rôle crucial de la Région dans la réalisation du développement territorial durable.

En outre, le ministre a relevé que pour une meilleure efficacité de ces efforts, des actions complémentaires ont été mises en œuvre, telles que l’Initiative “Ceinture bleue” initiée par le Maroc à l’occasion de la COP22, la lutte contre la pollution marine et plastique, l’instauration des aires marines protégées, notant que le Maroc a par ailleurs promulgué une loi dédiée à la gestion de son littoral.

Conscient des enjeux environnementaux et de la responsabilité partagée de lutte contre les effets des changements climatiques, le Maroc a révisé à la hausse sa Contribution Déterminée au niveau National (NDC) avec l’ambition de réduire les émissions des gaz à effet de serre de 45,5 % à l’horizon de 2030.

Par ailleurs, M. Sadiki a fait remarquer que chaque jour qui passe sans action pour une protection effective des océans, le potentiel inestimable de croissance économique, de développement social et culturel que renferment les espaces marins se trouve compromis et la survie et le bien-être de l’humanité fragilisés.

Pour faire face à ces défis et inverser les tendances lourdes, la communauté internationale doit repenser son mode de développement, a-t-il insisté, ajoutant à cet égard, que l’économie bleue présente aujourd’hui une nouvelle opportunité qui s’inscrit parfaitement dans l’esprit de durabilité et de résilience prôné par l’agenda des Nations Unies pour le développement durable.” A ce titre, l’instauration d’une gouvernance rationnelle et équitable des océans s’impose”, préconise le ministre.

La Conférence sur les océans a pour objectif la mise en place de solutions innovantes fondées sur la science, afin d’ouvrir un nouveau chapitre de l’action mondiale en faveur des océans. Elle constitue l’un des premiers jalons de la décennie d’action pour atteindre les 17 objectifs du développement durable à l’horizon 2030.

La plénière du premier jour en présence des Chefs d’Etat a été réservée aux allocutions d’ouverture, à l’adoption des règles de procédures et à l’élection des organes de la conférence.

Les Océans sont plus que jamais menacés par la pollution marine, la dégradation causée par différentes formes d’exploitation et d’activités humaines destructrices, exacerbées par les effets néfastes des changements climatiques et la perte de la biodiversité.

La délégation marocaine conduite par le ministre, comporte des représentants des départements de la Pêche maritime, Développement durable, Marine marchande, Intérieur, Affaires étrangères, Finances, Marine Royale, ainsi que l’Agence nationale des Ports (ANP), l’Institut national de recherche halieutique (INRH), l’Agence nationale pour le développement de l’aquaculture (ANDA), la Fondation Mohammed VI pour la protection de l’Environnement, la Fédération des Industries de transformation et de valorisation des produits de la Pêche (FENIP), et les représentants des corps élus.

Les deux panels du « Blue Talk » ont été l’opportunité pour les intervenants et les participants de souligner, en particulier au Maroc et en Afrique, le rôle de la science et de l’innovation pour une exploitation durable des océans, d’approfondir les bases d’échanges thématiques prioritaires à aborder dans le cadre de la Conférence des Nations Unies de Lisbonne, de renforcer la dynamique en facteur de la décennie des Nations Unies pour les sciences océaniques au service du développement durable, de bâtir et démultiplier des partenariats existants fructueux et de stimuler la création de nouveaux partenariats innovants et orientés vers l’impact positif concret et durable.

A cette occasion, M. José Maria Costa, Secrétaire d’État de la Mer du Portugal a déclaré que « La deuxième Conférence des Nations Unies sur les océans, qui se déroule à Lisbonne du 27 juin au 1er juillet, est l’étape idéale pour passer de la discussion à l’action. Le Portugal espère que toutes les nations du monde se rendront à la Conférence des Nations Unies sur les Océans avec une forte ambition et des engagements à prendre des mesures pour inverser le déclin de la santé des océans.

Le Portugal espère que les engagements ambitieux pris lors de la Conférence conduiront à la pleine mise en œuvre des cibles de l’ODD 14, de l’Initiative 30by30 visant à protéger 30 % des océans d’ici 2030 et au soutien des actions prévues et futures de la Décennie des Nations Unies pour les sciences océaniques au service du développement durable.»

La Fondation Mohammed VI pour la Protection de l’Environnement fidèle à sa mission fondamentale de sensibilisation et d’éducation œuvre depuis 20 ans à la mobilisation de l’ensemble des acteurs pour s’engager davantage dans la protection de l’environnement et du développement durable.

361,2022-06-28,Maroc: Lisbonne - Le pays totalement engagé pour faire face aux défis liés à la protection des océans (M. Sadiki),https://fr.allafrica.com/stories/202206280720.html,1,0,1,0,fr.allafrica.com,Morroco,"Rabat — Le Maroc est totalement engagé auprès de la communauté internationale pour faire face aux défis liés à la protection des océans, à la préservation de la biodiversité et aux changements climatiques, a affirmé, lundi à Lisbonne, le ministre de l'Agriculture, de la Pêche maritime, du Développement rural et des Eaux et Forêts, Mohamed Sadiki.

Cet engagement se confirme à travers l'adhésion du Royaume et sa ratification des instruments juridiques pertinents au milieu marin et son action constante pour le renforcement des cadres collaboratifs qui en découlent, a précisé M. Sadiki dans son allocution lors de la plénière d'ouverture de la Conférence des Nations Unies sur les Océans, qui se tient du 27 juin au 1er juillet 2022 dans la capitale portugaise, indique le ministère dans un communiqué.

""Fort de l'expérience réussie de plusieurs stratégies sectorielles, dont la stratégie Halieutis pour le développement du secteur halieutique lancée en 2009 et d'une recherche océanographique renforcée permettant une réelle surveillance océanographique et halieutique, le Maroc s'est engagé dans un programme ambitieux de développement de l'économie bleue, visant le renforcement de l'intégration de ses stratégies sectorielles maritimes autour d'une vision écosystémique inclusive, performante et innovante"", a soutenu le ministre.

Et en vue d'assurer un équilibre dans la gestion de son espace maritime, a poursuivi M. Sadiki, le Maroc a engagé un processus de planification spatiale maritime, visant l'accélération de l'émergence de véritables écosystèmes économiques maritimes en phase avec la politique nationale de régionalisation avancée qui érige le rôle crucial de la Région dans la réalisation du développement territorial durable.

En outre, le ministre a relevé que pour une meilleure efficacité de ces efforts, des actions complémentaires ont été mises en œuvre, telles que l'Initiative ""Ceinture bleue"" initiée par le Maroc à l'occasion de la COP22, la lutte contre la pollution marine et plastique, l'instauration des aires marines protégées, notant que le Maroc a par ailleurs promulgué une loi dédiée à la gestion de son littoral.

Conscient des enjeux environnementaux et de la responsabilité partagée de lutte contre les effets des changements climatiques, le Maroc a révisé à la hausse sa Contribution Déterminée au niveau National (NDC) avec l'ambition de réduire les émissions des gaz à effet de serre de 45,5 % à l'horizon de 2030.

Par ailleurs, M. Sadiki a fait remarquer que chaque jour qui passe sans action pour une protection effective des océans, le potentiel inestimable de croissance économique, de développement social et culturel que renferment les espaces marins se trouve compromis et la survie et le bien-être de l'humanité fragilisés.

Pour faire face à ces défis et inverser les tendances lourdes, la communauté internationale doit repenser son mode de développement, a-t-il insisté, ajoutant à cet égard, que l'économie bleue présente aujourd'hui une nouvelle opportunité qui s'inscrit parfaitement dans l'esprit de durabilité et de résilience prôné par l'agenda des Nations Unies pour le développement durable."" A ce titre, l'instauration d'une gouvernance rationnelle et équitable des océans s'impose"", préconise le ministre.

La Conférence sur les océans a pour objectif la mise en place de solutions innovantes fondées sur la science, afin d'ouvrir un nouveau chapitre de l'action mondiale en faveur des océans. Elle constitue l'un des premiers jalons de la décennie d'action pour atteindre les 17 objectifs du développement durable à l'horizon 2030.

La plénière du premier jour en présence des Chefs d'Etat a été réservée aux allocutions d'ouverture, à l'adoption des règles de procédures et à l'élection des organes de la conférence.

Les Océans sont plus que jamais menacés par la pollution marine, la dégradation causée par différentes formes d'exploitation et d'activités humaines destructrices, exacerbées par les effets néfastes des changements climatiques et la perte de la biodiversité.

Namibia has thrown its support for the newly formed High-Level Ambition Coalition for marine biodiversity in maritime

areas beyond national jurisdiction (HABITAT), President Hage Geingob has said.

Geingob made these remarks during the first edition of the One Ocean Summit taking place in Brest, France.

The Coalition, according to Geingob, will contribute to strengthening the protection of marine ecosystems.

The One Ocean Summit aims to mobilise the international community to take tangible action towards preserving and supporting a healthy and sustainable ocean.

“The work of the Panel, based among others on a three-track approach: the political track, the action track and the knowledge track, with each track emphasising a commitment to manage 100% of the ocean area under national sustainably

jurisdiction through Sustainable Ocean Plans by 2025, provides us with the necessary impetus to reverse coastal erosion, loss of biodiversity and ocean degradation,” said Geingob.

He further said that Namibia is also developing Green Hydrogen to limit the impacts of climate change and its consequences on rising sea levels and global warming.

Geingob said that the calendar of events for the Oceans Panel for the forthcoming months is rigorous, with planned activities focusing on ocean resilience.

He said this would make the Panel a reference point in matters of global ocean governance.

“We cannot continue to talk about threats to our ocean abstractly or to offer one-dimensional solutions that could hinder the implementation of the recommendations from

climate change experts. The ocean gives us food. It gives us life and connects human beings in extraordinary ways. Therefore, its protection is not optional but vital for the survival of our global village.

“As such, through initiatives such as the One Ocean Summit, we should recommit to act now to protect the vital resource of our

ocean for our continued livelihoods,” said Geingob.

According to OceanCare, a wildlife protection NGO, in March, negotiators from across the globe will gather at the United Nations headquarters in New York for the fourth and final intergovernmental conference on a new international legally binding treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ Treaty).

The group further said that the commitments taken at the summit were a step in the right direction but not ambitious enough.

“The HAC Declaration does not go far enough. As countries prepare and ultimately engage in negotiations in the context of the fourth IGC next month, we hope that countries will reach beyond the commitments and objectives laid out in the High Ambition Coalition Declaration. The world is already confronted with the impacts of climate change and the environmental emergency, and the protection of our ocean is critical in fending off the worst,” said the NGO.",en,"New York, Namibia, Brest, France","Panel, HABITAT, Sustainable Ocean Plans, the Oceans Panel, NGO, United Nations, Coalition, OceanCare, High-Level Ambition Coalition for marine biodiversity in, NAMIBIA, Eagle FM",Hage Geingob,"ocean, geingob, protection, track, marine, summit, namibia, ngo, coalition, national"

365,2022-02-21,Deep sea trawling target of new mural,https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/deep-sea-trawling-target-new-mural,163,157,6,0,odt.co.nz,New Zealand,"It is hoped a new mural being painted in Dunedin’s warehouse district will highlight the damage done by deep sea trawlers.

Deep Sea Conservation Coalition ocean advocate Karli Thomas said the mural, in Buller St, was being painted in order to draw attention to the negative environmental impact of deep sea trawling in New Zealand.

Ms Thomas said such trawling destroyed biodiversity hotspots, in particular sponge and coral populations, which supported other, more complex, forms of marine life.

Despite being an important resource which could take hundreds, or thousands, of years to grow, coral and sponge was being destroyed instead of protected, she said.

New Zealand was the only country left in the South Pacific to allow the destructive practice, she said.

The fishing practice, in which weighted nets are dragged along seamounts to scoop up fish like orange roughy, was undertaken by three companies in New Zealand waters, she said.

The conservation coalition wanted the practice to end.

As part of the group’s ""Defend the Deep"" tour, four murals were planned

One had already been completed in Auckland, one in Raglan and one in Wellington would follow, Ms Thomas said

Artist Cinzah Merkens said he had done the first mural for the campaign in Ponsonby Rd, in Auckland.

He had been approached for the project through a friend as he did a lot of work for environmental causes.

The Buller St artwork was his first substantial mural in Dunedin and his first time painting in the city since 2012.

He said the topic of the mural, the orange roughy, was chosen because it was targeted by deep sea fishers.

""It’s a really expressive looking fish and you can have a lot of fun accentuating some of those features,"" he said.

366,2022-09-23,Help revitalise the Hauraki Gulf by having your say on marine protection,https://www.doc.govt.nz/get-involved/have-your-say/all-consultations/2022-consultations/help-revitalise-hauraki-gulf/,73,73,0,0,doc.govt.nz,New Zealand,"We are seeking feedback on marine protection proposals that aim to revitalise the Hauraki Gulf. The proposals are for 19 new protected zones, created using two new marine protection tools. These tools will be established through new legislation.

The proposals will increase the area under protection in the Gulf from just over 6% to about 18%. This increase will support the recovery of some of its most biodiverse regions.

Read the information document (PDF, 1,286 K)

These proposals were first announced in the strategy ‘Revitalising the Gulf: Government action on the Sea Change Plan’ in 2021. Then they were refined after engagement with mana whenua in the Gulf.

The current proposals have been proposed by the Minister of Conservation and the Minister for Oceans and Fisheries.

What is in the proposals?

The marine protection proposals include the following:

12 High Protection Areas (HPAs): These will protect and enhance marine communities, ecosystems, and habitats. HPAs will provide for the expression of customary practices by mana whenua. This means customary practices can continue in HPAs, through existing regulatory arrangements, in a way that is consistent with the area’s biodiversity objectives.

5 Seafloor Protection Areas: These areas will protect sensitive sea floor habitats. They will do this by prohibiting activities that damage or disturb the seafloor, like bottom trawling and mining. But they will still allow for activities that do not conflict with seafloor protection objectives. Such as fishing that does not use bottom-contact methods, snorkelling, and kayaking.

2 protected areas: These will be adjacent to to Cathedral Cove | Whanganui-a-Hei and Cape Rodney-Okakari Point marine reserves. These will be established as either two new High Protection Areas, or as extensions to the two existing marine reserves.

More information on the above proposals can be found in our information document and on pages 60 - 61 of Revitalising the Gulf (PDF, 4,798K).

What has changed since 'Revitalising the Gulf' was released?

Since the Government released the Revitalising the Gulf strategy document in 2021, we have:

engaged with mana whenua in the Gulf to understand how customary practices could be managed within HPAs; and

included an additional HPA proposal around Ōtata / the Noises Islands.

Potential impact on commerical fishers

We commissioned an assessment of current commercial fishing activity within the proposed protection areas to determine the potential impact of the proposals.

This assessment was based on various data. It includes port, export and annual catch entitlement (ACE) prices. It also includes total allowable catch, fish stock, species, fishing method and location, total landings/monthly harvest returns, and reported catch effort.

Read the report (PDF 1,246K)

We are seeking feedback from fishers and their industry bodies to explore the potential impacts further. Ministers will consider all feedback when they make their final decisions.

There is also an assessment underway on the potential impact of the Revitalising the Gulf marine protection proposals on recreational fishers.

What the report showed

The assessment shows that a small number of commercial fishers (less than 10) did more than 15% of their fishing within the proposed protection areas in 2019/20 and 2020/21.

A few of those fished within the proposed protection areas in only one of the two years. We know that fishing patterns and effort can be highly variable between years, and this is reflected in the assessment.

Limitations of the report

The above report does not represent a broader assessment of the potential impact of the Revitalising the Gulf marine protection proposals on the wider commercial sector.

Some parts of the report have also been redacted due to the presence of fine scale information that may be commercially sensitive.

More information on the caveats and limitations associated with the assessment are outlined on page 6 of the report.

How to submit your feedback

We are seeking feedback on the proposals outlined in the information document.

We are particularly interested to hear from mana whenua, Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act applicants, and key stakeholders.

Stakeholders include recreational and commercial fishers, divers, researchers, and community groups.

“We are facing twin crises for biodiversity and the climate, and they are intrinsically linked. There are approximately 4,000 native species threatened or at risk of extinction, mainly because of introduced predators, and climate change is increasing this risk,"" Minister of Conservation Kiri Allan says.

""If we want our kids and grandkids to know the wonder of a swooping Antipodean albatross or the exquisite taste of a whitebait fritter then we really have to fire up our efforts in this area.

“The Predator Free 2050 goal receives a boost with more support for inspiring community efforts across the country, and further predator eradications on offshore islands.

""There will also be more emphasis on developing innovative tools and techniques to control predators and help our indigenous species thrive. Research will look at how mātauranga Māori approaches can accelerate progress toward New Zealand becoming Predator Free.

“Budget 2022 funding will be used to boost DOC’s national predator control programme. This programme delivers increased sustained predator control – from 450,000 to 600,000 hectares per year – which protects highly threatened species across more than 1.7 million hectares of public conservation land.

“As well as protecting species on the land, DOC will also be taking measures to reduce the risk of extinction of key marine species such as Māui dolphins and migratory seabirds.

“We want to improve our understanding of how toxoplasmosis gets into the Māui dolphin habitat and ultimately reduce the number of deaths from this disease. Funding is provided for further action to protect Antipodean albatross, Whenua Hou diving petrel and black petrel.""

There will also be support to improve localised marine protection for the Hauraki Gulf and the southeast of the South Island.

“Another key piece of work will be establishing a new national programme for deer management and goat control to help maintain forest integrity and resilience to climate change, while maintaining hunting opportunities,"" Kiri Allan says.

“This programme will be delivered in partnership with the hunting sector, and provide leadership and coordination with the people, organisations and agencies involved in wild animal management. For indigenous biodiversity to thrive, the ecological impacts of goats and deer must be managed while respecting the culture, recreational and economic values that these animals may provide.”

Budget 2022 sees an additional $400m for DOC to undertake its work, which will help significantly with progressing the recently released implementation plan for the Aotearoa New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy, and help New Zealand achieve its future carbon goals.

Alongside that DOC will take part in a multi-agency project to maximise carbon sequestration in native forests, and will transition more of its passenger vehicles to electric.

The new funding will also ensure visitor assets, such as tracks, huts and campsites, are more resilient to natural hazards and extreme weather events, and continue to provide unforgettable experiences for international visitors as we reconnect with the world. Cultural heritage assets at DOC-managed sites, including 11 Tohu Whenua sites, will also be strengthened so that New Zealanders and overseas visitors can continue to connect with New Zealand’s most treasured heritage places.

“Outside of the COVID response and the Jobs for Nature programme, Budget 2022 represents the single largest baseline investment in conservation and biodiversity in years, demonstrating this Government’s commitment to protecting nature now and for future generations,” Kiri Allan said.

Motueka Department of Conservation ranger Stew Robertson will travel to Indonesia to study local communities’ involvement in marine protected areas as the 2022 winner of DOC’s Stephen O’Dea Development Award.

The Stephen O’Dea Development Award was established in memory of Stephen O’Dea, the Field Centre Manager at Punakaiki who died along with 13 Tai Poutini Polytechnic students when the Cave Creek viewing platform collapsed on 28 April 1995. The naming of the recipient of the annual award is timed for World Ranger Day 31 July.

DOC Director-General Penny Nelson says the Stephen O’Dea Development Award provides DOC’s frontline staff with a professional development opportunity in conservation management.

“Stew has been a Marine Reserves Ranger for nearly two years and the award will enable him to travel to Indonesia to learn about marine protection in the Raja Ampat archipelago, a globally significant marine biodiversity hotspot at the heart of the Coral Triangle.

“Stew will look at how marine conservation organisations have worked with local communities to create and manage a large marine protected area network. It will assist our understanding on ways DOC, mana whenua iwi and local communities can best work together to protect and enhance our marine environment.”

Stew Robertson says he was inspired to visit and learn about marine protection in Raja Ampat after seeing it featured in a documentary he watched when sick with COVD-19 earlier this year.

“I dreamed about going to Raja Ampat to learn about what they do and I’m thrilled to be getting the opportunity through the Stephen O’Dea Development Award. I plan to bring back a kete of knowledge we can learn from,” says Stew Robertson.

“As a Marine Reserve Ranger my role includes patrolling to ensure people are complying with marine reserve rules, including not fishing, and educating people about marine reserves. I am especially interested in the work of local marine rangers in Raja Ampat and how their compliance effort has significantly contributed to marine life rebounding in protected areas.”

Background information

World Ranger Day is observed annually on 31 July commemorating rangers killed or injured in the line of duty and celebrates the work rangers do to protect the world's natural and cultural treasures.

Raja Ampat is an archipelago of more than 1,400 islands situated off the northwest tip of Bird’s Head Peninsula on Papua, Indonesia’s most eastern island. It is within the Bird’s Head Seascape, established in 2004, that is dependent on a strong union of international NGOs and local, regency, provincial and national governments, coastal communities, local organisations, and universities, to balance the needs of the Seascape’s human population while protecting its rich natural resources

Negotiations on a UN Ocean Treaty have just concluded without an agreement, but momentum for action is building and the Green Party is calling on the Government to pull out all the stops to conclude talks before the end of the year.

“It took until the final hours before countries started to show the sort of ambition needed to protect our precious oceans. Unfortunately it was too little too late, but we remain hopeful that world leaders will step up and do what is necessary to protect ocean health for future generations,” says the Green Party’s spokesperson for oceans and fisheries, Eugenie Sage.

The fifth round of negotiations on a global oceans treaty have been taking place at the United Nations in New York all week. The talks concluded without an agreement that can deliver Marine Protected Areas across 30 percent of the oceans by 2030, despite significant progress being made during the last 48 hours.

“The ocean plays a vital role in regulating the health of our planet. It provides half of the oxygen we breathe, food for communities right across the world, and is home to some of the world’s most spectacular wildlife.

“But for decades governments have been trading all of this away in the name of making a short-term profit. Destructive industries like mining and dirty fishing, climate change, and sediment pollution have been inflicting serious injury on our oceans.

“As a member of the High Ambition Coalition, New Zealand promised to deliver a strong Global Ocean Treaty that can protect the high seas by the end of 2022. While it sounds like progress was made, particularly on the creation of new ocean sanctuaries, it came too late to get an agreement over the line.

“We’re extremely disappointed that these most recent talks failed to deliver the treaty that our precious marine wildlife and billions of people around the world are depending on. However, there is some hope to be found in the fact that countries have agreed to come back together at some point in the future to try again.

“If we’re going to get a treaty in place by the end of the year – as the High Ambition Coalition promised – then the New Zealand Government needs to stand with our Pacific neighbours and do everything it possibly can to make sure a Global Ocean Treaty is adopted. We call on the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to contact their counterparts in other member states of the High Ambition Coalition to urge them to deliver on their commitment.

“The Green Party is clear that to be a success, the Treaty must create a framework to put parts of the high seas into marine sanctuaries, so at least 30% of the world’s oceans are protected by 2030. These Marine Protected Areas must be established under the Treaty independent of the influence of industrial fishery interests.

“The window of opportunity to protect our oceans is closing fast, but there is still time. The fight for strong ocean protection continues,” says Eugenie Sage.

Marine protection process begins in Otago



The planning forum for marine protected areas on the south east coast of the South Island has met for the first time.

In a two day meeting at Otākou marae (30 June - 1 July), members of the South-East Marine Protection Planning Forum/Roopu Manaaki ki te Toka began planning for a major community and business consultation process on a suite of management measures to protect key sites, habitats and species from Timaru down to Waipapa Point in Southland.

Forum chair Maree Baker-Galloway hopes as many people as possible will get involved. The forum wants to understand the history of the marine environment, what has changed, what people value about it, what the threats are to those values and what communities want to see happen to their marine environments in the future.

“The forum will have a comprehensive programme of community engagement because we want our final recommendations to have the fullest possible support from people who use and love our coastal waters.”

“We urge local people to keep an eye out for meetings and events and come along over the next 6 - 12 months. We’ll also have a web and social media presence. We want to give everyone who has something to say the opportunity to do so.”

The forum has been created with support from the Department of Conservation and the Ministry for Primary Industries, and its membership represents a broad spread of interested parties, including iwi, community groups, and fisheries, science, tourism and environmental interests.

The forum’s work should take about two years, and will include an initial listening and information gathering phase followed by a formal submission process. The forum will then finalise its recommendations on management measures to protect key sites, habitats and species for the Ministers of Conservation and Primary Industries to consider.

374,2022-07-19,MARPOL Annex VI – Marine Protection Rules Part 199: Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships (Part 199),https://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/content/rules/MARPOL-Annex-VI/default.asp,0,0,0,0,maritimenz.govt.nz,New Zealand,"You can access the full text of MARPOL Annex VI and all the documents that are incorporated by reference in Part 199 here:

The MARPOL Annex VI requirements are given effect by the Marine Protection Rules Part 199: Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships and the Engine Fuel Specification Regulations (administered by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment). The rules apply to New Zealand ships at all times and to all other ships in seas under New Zealand’s jurisdiction, except for warships and ships of the New Zealand Defence Force. The rules do not apply to ships that only operate in inland waters, such as lakes or rivers.

New Zealand signed up to Annex VI of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) on 26 May 2022. MARPOL has six annexes categorised by pollution type. Annex VI of MARPOL seeks to address the impact of air pollution from shipping activities on human health and environments in and around port communities, and the impacts of emissions from shipping activities on climate change and ozone layer depletion.

The Maritime Protection Rules Part 199: Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships (Part 199) brings the requirements of Annex VI into effect in New Zealand law. Part 199 comes into force progressively from 26 August 2022.

On 26 May 2022, New Zealand signed up to the IMO convention known as MARPOL Annex VI.

You can use an optional questionnaire tool to find out which requirements may apply to your ship. The tool provides an indication only; it is the responsibility for ship operators to carefully consider all the requirements in Part 199 to correctly identify which requirements apply to their ship.

We have developed guidance to help ship operators identify which requirements apply to their ships

Summary of the main requirements in Part 199

The main requirements in Part 199 are summarised below.

Fuel requirements The rules introduce the following fuel requirements: all ships must use low sulphur fuels such as petrol, diesel or other petroleum or non-petroleum distillate fuels (or use acceptable alternative means to manage sulphur emissions);

all fuels used must meet specific fuel quality standards;

all ships 400 GT or more must keep bunker delivery notes; and

international voyaging ships 400 GT or more must also keep fuel samples. Ship operators that cannot access low sulphur fuels for a specific voyage must notify the Director of Maritime NZ and the authorities at the destination port prior to their departure. Ship operators are required to meet the fuel requirements from the date the rules come into effect. Sulphur oxides (SOₓ) pollutants are the by-products of fuel combustion in an engine. The higher the level of sulphur in the fuel, the more SOₓ are emitted in exhaust gases. The actual amount of SOₓ created in the process depends on the combustion temperature and pressure, the level of oxygen exposure in the process, and the level of sulphur in the fuel. Emitted SOₓ react with water vapour creating sulphuric acid, a corrosive substance known to cause harm to environments and marine species. Sulphuric acid also poses a serious health risk to people. Engine exhausts emit particulate matter (PM) which is primarily soot with a lesser portion of heavy metals and other chemicals that result from the combustion process. The smaller the particles of PM the higher the health risk to people who are exposed. PM can get deep into a person’s lungs and bloodstream and is a known carcinogen. Using combustible fuels with a lower sulphur content will reduce the overall emissions of SOₓ and PM into the atmosphere. Ship operators have the option to use either low sulphur petroleum distillate fuels, diesel, blended residual fuels or other fuels that have low to zero sulphur content, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or biofuels. Alternatively, ship operators may seek Director Approval to use higher sulphur fuels so long as they are also using technologies that can remove pollutants from engine exhaust fumes before the fumes are released into the air. An example of these technologies is exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS, or exhaust scrubbers). Section 3: Fuel requirements[PDF: 1.9MB, 76 pages]

Nitrogen oxide emission (NOₓ) engine emission requirements for international voyaging ships The rules introduce limits on the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) from many installed engines over 130 kW power output on ships. There are specific requirements for testing, survey and certification of engines to ensure they comply with the Technical Code on Control of Emission of Nitrogen Oxides from Marine Diesel Engines (known as the NOₓ Technical Code 2008). Ships cause emissions of NOₓ from the combustion of fuel in engines. NOₓ are air pollutants; NOₓ gases also react to form smog and acid rain and form fine particles and ground level ozone, all of which can harm public health. The rules require installed engines, other than those solely used for emergency purposes, to be designed and operated under maximum limits of NOₓ emissions. The rules apply to engines over 130 kW output power (ie over 174.3 horsepower) installed on international voyaging ships constructed since 1 January 2000. As evidence of compliance with the NOₓ requirements, internationally voyaging ships must carry a technical file and Engine International Air Pollution Prevention (EIAPP) certificate for each engine over 130 kW. The EIAPP certificate is usually issued by the maritime administration of the country where the engine was manufactured. For each EIAPP certified engine there must be a technical file on board which defines specific parameters for compliant operation of the engine on board the ship, and provides procedures for verification of compliance and any additional relevant documentation. The technical file and EIAPP certificate are provided by the engine manufacturer. These documents may be amended, for example if the engine undergoes modifications. If the EIAPP certificate states the engine’s compliance with the NOₓ emission limits must be tested using the Engine Parameter Check Method, the ship operator must keep a record book of engine parameters. Section 4: Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission limits

for international voyaging ships[PDF: 1.9MB, 76 pages]

Nitrogen oxide emission (NOₓ) engine emission requirements for domestic voyaging ships Section C3 of Part 199 states the NOₓ emission requirements for domestic voyaging ships. Section C3 is currently suspended. This means the requirements in Section C3 will come into force at a later date. If you have an engine on your ship or are about to install an engine that will need to meet the NOx emission limits ensure you get the necessary documentation. Details on what documentation is needed are in the link below. Part 199 introduces limits on the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) from many installed engines over 130 kW power output on ships other than those engines used solely for emergencies. There are specific requirements for testing, survey and certification of installed engines on domestic voyaging ships that were constructed or last had a major conversion on or after 19 May 2005. Domestic voyaging ships are those that never voyage to foreign ports or terminals. A voyage beyond New Zealand’s jurisdiction that returns without visiting a foreign port or terminal is considered to be a domestic voyage. While international voyaging ships must hold a technical file and EIAPP certificate as evidence of compliance with the NOₓ emission limits, Part 199 allows domestic voyaging ships options for demonstrating compliance. Surveyors will carefully assess the evidence provided by a ship operator to ensure they can be satisfied it demonstrates the engine is likely to meet the required NOₓ emission limits. As with the internationally voyaging ships, domestic voyaging ship operators can carry a technical file and Engine International Air Pollution Prevention (EIAPP) certificate for engines over 130 kW. Technical files and EIAPP certificates are only available for engines designed for marine use. Section 5: Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission limits

for domestic voyaging commercial ships[PDF: 1.9MB, 76 pages]

Control of other air pollutants Ships are required to prevent the emission of air pollutants from installed equipment that contain ozone depleting substances (ODS) and from shipboard incinerators. This equipment must be carefully managed in line with the requirements in Part 199. Tankers that carry crude oil are also required to have a management plan to prevent unintended emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC). Erosion of the ozone layer contributes to the damaging effect of climate change on people and the environment. ODS can also be potent greenhouse gases, and contribute to climate change. International efforts to reduce the use of ODS under the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and its protocols have been successful. The requirements to phase out ODS have been included in MARPOL Annex VI to ensure compliance by the international shipping sector. MARPOL Annex VI places restrictions on the use of shipboard incinerators to protect port communities. Depending on what is being incinerated, and the design and operation of the incinerator, the emissions can be highly toxic. As the particulate matter (PM) from the smoke settles, the carcinogenic compounds can be inhaled by people, animals and other species and damage natural environments. Volatile organic compounds (VOC) are gaseous at room temperature and flammable. New Zealand tankers carrying crude oil and other petroleum distillates must manage the potential for air pollution by VOC. Section 6: Control of other air pollutants[PDF: 1.9MB, 76 pages]

Carbon intensity reduction requirements for ships 400 GT or more To reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, ships 400 gross tonnage (GT) or more are required to identify and manage the carbon intensity of the ship’s operations. All ships 400 GT or more must have a Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) developed specifically for the ship. Some ships must also have a calculation of either the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) or, from the next intermediate or renewal survey after 1 January 2023, the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) of their ship. Whether an EEDI or EEXI applies depends on the date of construction of the ship, though some categories of ships are excluded from the EEDI/EEXI requirements. International voyaging ships must hold an International Energy Efficiency (IEE) certificate to demonstrate to maritime administrations that the ship is compliant with the carbon intensity reduction requirements. Domestic voyaging ships may choose to have either the IEE certificate or an Annex VI Endorsement on the ship’s Certificate of Survey. The purpose of the requirements is to reduce the carbon intensity of international shipping to contribute to the IMO’s Initial IMO strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships. Section 7: Carbon intensity reduction requirements

for ships 400 gross tonnage (GT) or more[PDF: 1.9MB, 76 pages]

Reporting requirements for ships 5000 GT or more Most ships 5000 gross tonnage (GT) or more will need to submit an annual report for the previous calendar year’s fuel consumption to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). Some of these ships will also need to have an Attained Annual Operational Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) calculated and report on the resulting CII rating annually to the IMO also. If the IMO considers the rating to be unsatisfactory, the ship is required to take action to improve the CII rating. The ships that submit annual reports must hold a Statement of Compliance issued by the Director, or an RO, for each year to show that reporting has been completed as required. The IMO collects data from ships to monitor the carbon intensity of international shipping; while maritime administrations need information about the carbon intensity of domestic shipping. The IMO, and maritime administrations, need a range of evidence to determine the effectiveness of the greenhouse gas reduction actions ships are required to take. The fuel oil consumption reports and CII ratings of ships will contribute the data needed to measure the efficacy of compliance with the carbon intensity reduction requirements. Section 8: Reporting for ships 5,000 GT or more[PDF: 1.9MB, 76 pages]

Survey and Certification for MARPOL Annex VI

Ship surveys

The surveys of ships (that are New Zealand ships when the rules come into effect) to verify compliance with Part 199 will be conducted at the next intermediate or renewal survey within the existing schedule of the surveys for each ship, after 1 January 2023. Ships that are newly constructed and ships that become New Zealand ships 26 August 2022 will have compliance checked at the initial survey.

Ship certificates

Part 199 requires most international voyaging ships of 400 GT or more to carry on board an International Air Pollution Prevention (IAPP) certificate and an International Energy Efficiency (lEE) certificate. Operators of domestic voyaging ships 400 GT or more can choose to either hold an Annex VI Endorsement on the ship’s Certificate of Survey or, hold the IAPP and IEE certificates. All commercial ships and internationally voyaging recreational ships under 400 GT must hold an Annex VI Endorsement on the ship’s Certificate of Survey, Barge Certificate of Safety, or certificate of fitness, whichever is applicable to the ship.

Ships that are New Zealand ships before 26 August 2022, need to get these certificates at the next scheduled intermediate or renewal survey after 1 January 2023.

A Statement of Compliance will be issued to each ship 5000 GT or more following correct annual submission and verification of fuel oil consumption data reports and, for carbon intensity ships, the ship’s annual Carbon Intensity Indicator rating.

Deadline extended for consultation on new marine protection policy

In response to calls from the public, consultation on the Government's draft marine protection policy has been extended to 28 February.

Submissions to the draft Marine Protected Areas Policy Statement and Implementation Plan were to have closed this Friday (21 January). Stakeholders who received the initial draft document have been advised in writing of the change.

""We've had many calls from interested groups asking for extension of the deadline for submissions and consequently asked Ministers of Conservation and Fisheries for an extension,"" Conservation Department principal policy analyst Jim Nicolson said today. ""This has now been given by both Ministers.""

In launching public consultations on 8 November last year, Conservation Minister Chris Carter said that he wished to ensure that the selection process for new sites for marine protection would cover a full range of sea life, while minimising the impact on ocean users, such as fishers.

Over the next five years, the Government would make a systematic, region-by-region assessment of needs and sites for protection, he said. Planning would involve government agencies, environmental organisations, fishing groups, Maori and others.

Negotiations on a UN Ocean Treaty have just concluded without an agreement, but momentum for action is building and the Green Party is calling on the Government to pull out all the stops to conclude talks before the end of the year.

""It took until the final hours before countries started to show the sort of ambition needed to protect our precious oceans. Unfortunately it was too little too late, but we remain hopeful that world leaders will step up and do what is necessary to protect ocean health for future generations,"" says the Green Party’s spokesperson for oceans and fisheries, Eugenie Sage.

The fifth round of negotiations on a global oceans treaty have been taking place at the United Nations in New York all week. The talks concluded without an agreement that can deliver Marine Protected Areas across 30 percent of the oceans by 2030, despite significant progress being made during the last 48 hours.

""The ocean plays a vital role in regulating the health of our planet. It provides half of the oxygen we breathe, food for communities right across the world, and is home to some of the world’s most spectacular wildlife.

""But for decades governments have been trading all of this away in the name of making a short-term profit. Destructive industries like mining and dirty fishing, climate change, and sediment pollution have been inflicting serious injury on our oceans.

""As a member of the High Ambition Coalition, New Zealand promised to deliver a strong Global Ocean Treaty that can protect the high seas by the end of 2022. While it sounds like progress was made, particularly on the creation of new ocean sanctuaries, it came too late to get an agreement over the line.

Following Quick Response To Rescue Crew Government Of Niue Now Focussing On Protecting MPA

Alofi, Niue - 11 June 2022 - The Government of Niue (GON) says that following a visit by its assessment team, including Police, Maritime, and Fisheries officials, to the Taiwanese FV CHUAN I SHIN grounded on Beveridge Reef, work to protect its MPA is now its key focus.

GON responded very quickly to ensure the rescue of the crew of the CHUAN I SHIN and then commenced a mission to assess the environmental situation in its MPA called Moana Mahu Marine Park which is 125 nautical miles south east of Niue.

Gaylene Tasmania, Niue’s acting Secretary of Government says that its assessment team found the CHUAN I SHIN on fire when they visited Moana Mahu Marine Park.

""While it was too unsafe for Niue’s assessment team to board the CHUAN I SHIN, we were able to review the conditions around the vessel grounded on Beveridge reef, conduct an investigation and gather important information,"" says Tasmania.

Tasmania adds that the investigation into the grounding of the CHUAN I SHIN is ongoing.

""While the investigation continues it would be inappropriate to comment any further. One of our priorities is to ensure that the Moana Mahu Marine Park and all Niue’s important conservation areas continue to be protected.""

The organisation made this known in a statement to mark this year’s World Oceans Day with the theme ‘Revitalisation: Collective Action for the Ocean’.

The Day celebrated annually aims to remind the world of the role the oceans play in everyday life, establishing, and highlighting people’s connection to the sea, as well as raising awareness on the essential role it plays in the overall health of the environment.

Earlier in the year, TheCable reported how some oil companies operating in Nigeria degan divesting from Nigeria’s oil industry and selling off their onshore assets.

Nnimo Bassey, HOMEF director, said this must not continue as polluting the ocean is a direct threat to humanity and these companies must be made to pay for their crimes.

He said there is need for collective action but this would not be possible if Nigeria does not define what the problems are, and who are responsible for the problems.

“We cannot talk about collective actions without first defining what the problems are, and who are responsible for the problems,” Nnimo was quoted as saying.

“It is crystal clear that industrial fishing, offshore exploration, and exploitation, dumping of waste offshore, and similar activities are the major drivers of pollutions and aquatic ecosystems destruction. We can only thrive when our oceans thrive. Polluting the ocean is a direct threat to humanity and polluters must not be allowed to divest without first accounting for their environmental sins.”

The statement added that it is important to begin to ask real questions as to who is destroying the oceans, seas, rivers, and creeks and that polluters must halt their activities, clean up the mess and make reparations for the harms they have inflicted.

It encouraged people to reflect on the state of the oceans, seas, rivers, and creeks especially for individuals and local communities who have lived in harmony with these water bodies and who need to be recognized, supported, and learned from.

It further said HOMEF used the occasion of the Ocean Day to inaugurate a FishNet Alliance chapter – a network of fishers in Africa – in the Ogulagha community in Delta.

“The degraded condition of the community is a sad commentary on the despoliation of the Niger Delta and the Gulf of Guinea by oil exploration and exploitation. Like many other extractive communities of the Niger Delta, Ogulagha community is incessantly impacted by oil spills and waste dumps that threaten not only the aquatic.”

Speaking on behalf of the Alliance, Stephen Oduware, HOMEF project officer, said “fishers are facing a lot of problems ranging from pollution to low catch of fish. Climate change impacts and insecurity at the high seas are real threats. It seems there is a deliberate attempt to erase fishers out of the equation and value chain.

“The recent plan by the Nigerian government to deploy genetically improved Tilapia fish (GIFT) buttresses this at the national level, while the current WTO chair’s negotiation text supporting overfishing through fisheries subsidies reinforces the sorry state at the global level.”

He called on national, regional, and continental governments to consult fishers on policies that govern aquatic ecosystems and support artisanal fishers because “they support the economy and provide employment”.",en,"Nigeria, Ogulagha","HOMEF, TheCable, Alliance, The Health of Mother Earth Foundation, WTO, FishNet Alliance","Nnimo Bassey, Stephen Oduware","oceans, ocean, problems, fishers, homef, nigeria, delta, oil, polluters, environmental"

“If we want to protect the ocean better, we must teach it better”, said Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO’s Director-General, speaking at the One Ocean Summit, taking place in the French city of Brest.

Setting it as a common objective for UNESCO’s 193 Member States, she asked them to include ocean education in school curricula by 2025.

To achieve the goal, the United Nations agency is making available to public decision-makers a toolkit with a shared reference framework of educational content on the subject.

The step will allow all countries to be in an “equal position to quickly place the ocean at the heart of teaching and increase students’ knowledge in this area, so that they become responsible and committed citizens”, added Stefania Giannini, UNESCO’s Assistant Director-General in charge of education.

The new educational tools provided by UNESCO reflect the conviction that the way society interacts with the ocean, needs to change in order to achieve a more sustainable model.

In its reference tool, UNESCO highlights the good practices of Member States already working on ocean education, such as Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Kenya, Portugal and Sweden.

The results achieved by these countries have been presented by the agency in the form of case studies, as well as the opportunities and challenges met when seeking to include ocean knowledge in a structured way in the curriculum. Unsplash/Hiroko YoshiiCalm and clear sea in Okinawa, Japan.

Traditional skills and knowledge

“Ocean education should not only involve the transmission of scientific knowledge and awareness of contemporary issues; it should also promote traditional skills and knowledge, such as those protected by the 2003 Convention on Intangible Cultural Heritage, which promotes ancestral fishing techniques, for example”, UNESCO reiterated in the press release.

The new toolkit leaves it to Member States and regions to adapt the “theory of change” to their specific practices, situations and needs.

The agency aims to monitor the implementation of this objective by its 193 Member States, with a first progress report planned for COP27, which will be held in November 2022 in Egypt.

UNESCO and the ocean

UNESCO is leading the United Nations Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (2021 to 2030), which this year will see the organization of several major international summits to promote ocean health.

At the same time, UNESCO has launched a campaign to empower concerned citizens to join the Generation Ocean global movement. https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1213545562&show_artwork=true

The idea is to use transformative storytelling, to connect citizens with more knowledge and drive action to restore, protect, and live better with the ocean.

Later this year, Portugal will be hosting the UN Ocean Conference, which will seek to propel much needed science-based innovative solutions aimed at starting a new chapter of global ocean action.

Scientific methods

After a strict quarantine period, the expedition team set off to collect underwater data about the coral reef ecosystems and fish populations of nearshore reef ecosystems to inform long term management strategies. Over a period of 15 days, researchers conducted coral reef surveys at 66 dive sites across the Republic of Palau collecting 3-D imagery of corals and quantifying reef fish assemblages.





Teams spent ~90 hours underwater and observed 400 species of fish. Using technology developed by the 100 Island Challenge, scientists captured ~265,000 coral reef images to develop 3-D maps that will show how reefs change over time . The Waitt Institute will produce a scientific report detailing the expedition’s findings.

Bul

Safeguarding the ocean is deeply rooted in Palau’s history and culture. For centuries, traditional leaders in Palau have worked to protect local waters through enactment of a “bul”— temporary bans on fishing or catching certain species in order to give marine life to a chance to regenerate and protect habitats critical to a community’s food security.

In June 2021, Panama expanded ​​the Cordillera de Coiba Marine Protected Area from approximately 6,500 to 26,200 square miles, accomplishing the goal of the Global Biodiversity Framework’s “30×30 Initiative” to protect 30% of the marine areas of the country by 2030. Less than a year later, in February 2022, Héctor Guzmán, a marine biologist with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI), together with a multidisciplinary consulting team, delivered the final management plan for the expanded protected area that was recently approved by the Ministry of the Environment of Panama, according to resolution number DM-No. 0089-2022 of March 3rd, 2022.

The expanded Cordillera de Coiba protected area, located 62 miles south of Coiba National Park, is unique in that it has several underwater mountain ranges teeming with undiscovered biodiversity. This ecosystem protects fourteen marine mammal species that use it as a migration and feeding area like the blue whale, the sperm whale and the northern fin whale, as well as sea turtles, marlins, sharks and other species, most of which are vulnerable or endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

The expansion of the Cordillera de Coiba marine protected area improves the connectivity of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor, strengthening the conservation and sustainable use of protected waters between Isla de Coco in Costa Rica, Galapagos in Ecuador, Malpelo and Gorgona in Colombia and Coiba in Panama.

“Months of hard work with our consulting team and more than 20 citizen consultations allowed us to design and justify the extension and the Management Plan of the Cordillera de Coiba protected area,” said Guzmán. “Thanks to the funds from the Wyss Foundation and STRI and the support of the MissionBlue Foundation, the Migramar Network and the local authorities for making this work possible.”

“It was a new experience for me to be able to coordinate with Hector such a large conservation effort for Panama, and we succeeded,” said Marco Díaz, general coordinator of the consulting team.

The plan entirely prohibits fishing in two thirds of the protected area, and only sustainable fishing, such as pole and line fishing, is allowed in the remaining third, which must be regulated appropriately. This will reduce bycatch of migratory species, which endangers the health of the oceans.

It also proposes a novel and dynamic zoning that must be re-evaluated every two years in adaptation to climate change and fisheries management, as well as a governance committee made up of representatives of the different local and international stakeholders for administration of the management plan. Among other things, the committee will ensure the approval of scientific research in the area, establish policies for the conservation and sustainable use of the protected area and manage the required assistance for meeting its objectives and improving its conditions.

“Thanks to the Blue Nature Alliance consortium, we were able to obtain additional funds for Panama to establish, for the first time in the country, a satellite monitoring system for the fishing fleet, which allows us to eradicate illegal fishing and control legal fishing,” Guzmán said. “This will be a genuinely protected area”

For STRI director, Joshua Tewksbury, it is a source of pride that the Institute has been part of the multidisciplinary interagency team that developed the justification for the expansion and the management plan for the expanded Cordillera de Coiba protected area and hopes to continue making science-based collaborations that allow the country to fulfill other milestones in favor of sustainability.

The One Ocean Summit in the northwestern port city of Brest on February 9-11 seeks to raise the international community’s ambitions to protect sealife, cut plastic pollution and tackle the impact of climate change.

The world’s five connected oceans regulate the climate, nurture millions of species, feed the world and enable trade but are still badly understood and lack protection.

President Emmanuel Macron hopes to eke “ambitious commitments” from “a small but determined” group of more than 40 countries and multinational companies, including European maritime transport giants Maersk, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd and MSC.

European Union leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel will address the summit in person as France heads the bloc’s six-month rotating presidency.

Environmental groups hope the Brest summit will jump-start efforts to finalise a wide-ranging and legally binding UN treaty in March.

The treaty would protect marine life in international waters — which cover nearly half the planet — and the expansion by one million square kilometres (386,102 square miles) of the marine reserve in Antarctica and the South Pacific.

But campaigners are also urging France to do more at this week’s summit, petitioning to stop dolphins being accidentally killed by fishing vessels off the French coast and demanding an end to French exploration of the deepest marine trenches.

These ocean trenches, more than four kilometres deep, are home to extraordinary marine life, much of which is not fully understood, and to potentially lucrative mineral resources.

“We have no idea what the ocean really is,” said Francoise Gaill, an expert at France’s national scientific research centre.

Last year, governments and NGOs at the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s World Conservation Congress approved an international moratorium on deep seabed mining.

France was one of several countries to reject the move.

The Brest summit comes ahead of major UN environmental negotiations in the coming months.

These include efforts to clinch a global agreement on curbing plastic waste, the high seas treaty, key summits on climate and biodiversity and a UN conference on the oceans.

The TRNP, a popular diving destination in Palawan, is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site, an Asean Heritage Park, and a known sea bird sanctuary.

Besides TRNP in the Sulu-Celebes Sea, the four MPA candidates in the Philippines are the Ticao-Burias Pass Protected Seascape in Masbate province, Bicol region; Agoo Damortis Protected Landscape and Seascape in La Union province; Bani-Bolinao-Burgos-Infanta, Dasol-Agno MPA Network in Pangasinan province; and Turtle Islands Wildlife Sanctuary in Tawi-Tawi province in Mindanao.

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) recently convened the stakeholders of the project titled, “Effectively Managing Networks of Marine Protected Areas in Large Marine Ecosystems [LME] in Asean [Enmaps],” to gather and consolidate data as it is scheduled to submit its project proposal to Global Environment Facility (GEF) by March 2023.

The sites being chosen for Enmaps are biodiversity-rich sites that also face threats of environmental degradation.

Beneficiaries of the project are Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.

Other Asean LME sites under the project are the Gulf of Thailand, Andaman Sea of the Bay of Bengal, the Indonesian Seas and the South China Sea.

The Asean Enmaps project will be executed by the Asean Centre for Biodiversity (ACB) in collaboration with the DENR’s Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB).

It includes national technical working groups from the Foreign Assisted and Special Projects Services of the DENR; the Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources; National Fisheries Research and Development Institute; and the intergovernmental organization Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia.

The coastal and marine biodiversity of Asean are known to have 20 percent of the world’s seagrass beds, a third of the world’s mangrove forests with 45 to 75 tree species, and a third of the world’s coral reefs with more than 75 percent of species of coral and 40 percent of fish species.

The GEF, multilateral environmental fund, has been concerned that the world’s oceans have been reaching their ecological carrying capacity, a limit to their ability to produce fish for food.

“More than 75 percent of world fish stocks are already fully exploited, overexploited, depleted or recovering from depletion,” according to the GEF web site.

Enmaps aims to develop and improve the management of networks of MPAs and marine corridors within selected LMEs in the Asean region.

It likewise aims to conserve globally significant biodiversity and support for sustainable fisheries for people’s livelihood and other ecosystem goods and services.

GEF has supported sustainable governance of 23 LMEs involving the collaborative work of many countries. The world’s oceans is known to be divided into 66 LMEs.

This area covers 7.7 million square kilometers with 173,000 km of coastline.

LMEs are huge marine areas extending beyond boundaries among countries which is why collaboration is important. Enmaps has a cost of $77.596 million. Of this, $12.548 million consists of GEF grants.

And unless they do something, nothing is going to change, and everything is going to continue on this terrible trajectory to three degrees or more and an totally uninhabitable planet,"" protester Sophie Miller told Reuters.

Sobre o EEA Grants

Através do Acordo sobre o Espaço Económico Europeu (EEE), a Islândia, o Liechtenstein e a Noruega são parceiros no mercado interno com os Estados-Membros da União Europeia.

Como forma de promover um contínuo e equilibrado reforço das relações económicas e comerciais, as partes do Acordo do EEE estabeleceram um Mecanismo Financeiro plurianual, conhecido como EEA Grants.

O EEA Grants tem como objetivos reduzir as disparidades sociais e económicas na Europa e reforçar as relações bilaterais entre estes três países e os países beneficiários.

Para o período 2014-2021, foi acordada uma contribuição total de 2,8 mil milhões de euros para 15 países beneficiários. Portugal beneficiará de uma verba de 102,7 milhões de euros.

400,2022-07-20,Proteção do Oceano: o compromisso do Pingo Doce,https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/c-studio/detalhe/protecao-do-oceano-o-compromisso-do-pingo-doce,28,28,0,0,jornaldenegocios.pt,Portugal,"A Conferência dos Oceanos virou todas as atenções para o mar, para os desafios de o preservar, assim como aos seus recursos, e para as soluções e projetos que já estão a mostrar como é possível contornar as piores expectativas. No maior evento paralelo à conferência, a iniciativa One Sustainable Ocean, o Grupo Jerónimo Martins, no qual se integra o Pingo Doce, partilhou alguns projetos de impacto e explicou a aposta na aquacultura, onde tem anunciado vários investimentos.

Pedro Encarnação, diretor de aquacultura da Jerónimo Martins Agro-Alimentar, admitiu a ambição de vir a conseguir responder a 50% das necessidades nacionais com produção própria, a partir da costa portuguesa e de Marrocos. Hoje, mais de 90% do pescado de aquacultura consumido em Portugal ainda é importado de países mediterrânicos, como a Grécia, por falta de escala da produção nacional e questões de preço. A longa viagem representa uma pegada ambiental elevada, que o Grupo quer reduzir, ao mesmo tempo que aumenta a frescura, com um produto que consegue levar à mesa do consumidor em 24 horas.

""O nosso foco está em criar cadeias de valor curtas, com uma baixa pegada ambiental e garantia da frescura do produto"", explicou o responsável numa das conferências do evento que acolheu 70 conferências e workshops, 12 exposições, 10 sessões de cinema, mostra de instalações artísticas e sessões de showcooking de cozinha sustentável.

60% das reservas selvagens de peixe estão em níveis máximos de exploração e 30% em sobre-exploração

A produção local do Grupo Jerónimo Martins é feita no mar, mantendo os peixes no seu ambiente natural, ao largo de Sines, da Madeira, de Marrocos e em breve no Algarve, onde está a arrancar um projeto de raiz, que será também um laboratório vivo para aperfeiçoar e inovar técnicas e processos de monitorização e controlo de qualidade.

A tecnologia e a ciência têm ajudado a encontrar novas respostas para as principais reticências dos consumidores com a aquacultura, que já suprime metade das necessidades mundiais de pescado e continuará a ter um papel fundamental a este nível, como também destacou Pedro Encarnação.

O Grupo Jerónimo Martins tem feito a sua parte, em colaboração com diferentes parceiros da área científica, que acompanham todos os projetos e desenvolvem inovações de melhoria. O investimento recentemente anunciado pelo Grupo na Noruega tem, precisamente, como primeira meta, o acesso à tecnologia inovadora que vai ser usada para produzir salmão, em condições próximas do seu ambiente natural, num processo altamente eficiente na gestão de resíduos e consumo de energia. Quando estiver a funcionar, daqui vão sair 19 mil toneladas de salmão por ano.

Fazer chegar a sustentabilidade a toda a cadeia de valor

Em simultâneo, o Grupo trabalha com os fornecedores de pescado para disseminar pesca e processos sustentáveis, em toda a cadeia de valor. ""Este é um caminho que tem de ser feito com a cadeia de valor. Os fornecedores também têm de estar preparados para fazer a certificação dos processos e isso depende dos recursos que têm"", admitiu, noutra apresentação do evento patrocinado pela marca, Ana Catarina Rovisco, Head of ESG Relations do Grupo Jerónimo Martins.

Com presença nos principais índices ESG a nível mundial, a retalhista reconhece a importância do papel desempenhado na mudança de práticas das empresas que têm à sua volta, muitas delas locais e de pequena ou média dimensão, sendo que, como também explicou Ana Rovisco, há um trabalho de parceria facilitado pelo facto de o Grupo já ter procedimentos de segurança alimentar, sustentabilidade ou licenciamento ambiental bem oleados.

O conhecimento das equipas internas ligadas a estas áreas, com pessoas que trabalham todos os processos em cada setor, também tem sido fundamental para consolidar uma base de conhecimento que acelera projetos internos e tem facilidade em ajudar a identificar prioridades de ação, junto dos fornecedores. Na área do pescado, em particular, nas insígnias do Grupo Jerónimo Martins já foram certificados 41 produtos embalados.

Portugal é o maior consumidor europeu de pescado e o 3º maior a nível mundial. Cada português come 56 kg de peixe por ano

Numa outra vertente, a marca tem apertado o controlo às variedades comercializadas nas suas peixarias. Começou por criar uma espécie de Bilhete de Identidade das espécies mais vendidas, para compreender de onde vêm, como vivem ou a intensidade do consumo, para perceber o impacto da pesca nos ecossistemas e na própria espécie. A partir de 2016, estendeu esse trabalho às 200 variedades de peixes e mariscos que comercializa, revendo anualmente a documentação científica disponível para afinar estratégias. Não comercializa espécies classificadas como ""criticamente em perigo"". Modera campanhas e privilegia a aquacultura, vs. selvagem, de espécies classificadas no nível ""vulnerável"".

Fontes de água filtrada da Eco Water chegam a 300 lojas Pingo Doce este ano

As parcerias têm sido outro caminho para fazer chegar ao consumidor opções mais sustentáveis, como aquela que existe com a Eco Water. A empresa portuguesa criou uma solução para combater a utilização de plástico descartável, associado ao consumo de água. Desenvolveu fontes que filtram água e as garrafas reutilizáveis para a transportar.

A parceria com o Pingo Doce já permitiu instalar estas fontes em mais de 190 lojas – até final do ano serão cerca de 300 –, que também comercializam as garrafas, que o cliente pode encher sempre que for às compras, por um valor quase simbólico.

Para mudar hábitos é preciso ""dar ao consumidor opções simples e práticas, que permitam mudar comportamentos no dia a dia"", defendeu André Paiva, cofundador do projeto. Os resultados estão à vista: 90% das garrafas vendidas já voltaram ao supermercado para reenchimento.",pt,"Portugal, Marrocos, Madeira","Grécia, a Eco Water, ESG Relations, Eco Water, A Conferência dos Oceanos, Grupo","Ana Rovisco, André Paiva, Pedro Encarnação, Ana Rovisco","grupo, jerónimo, martins, aquacultura, pescado, valor, projetos, consumidor, processos, ano"
401,2022-04-22,Estará Portugal preparado para ser um líder mundial na proteção do oceano?,https://www.publico.pt/2022/04/22/azul/opiniao/estara-portugal-preparado-lider-mundial-protecao-oceano-2002962,23,19,4,0,publico.pt,Portugal,"Lisboa acolhe, na última semana de junho, a II Conferência dos Oceanos das Nações Unidas, coorganizada pelos Governos de Portugal e do Quénia. Sob o lema “Salvar o oceano, proteger o futuro”, a conferência dedica-se ao Objetivo de Desenvolvimento Sustentável 14 – “Proteger a vida debaixo de água” –, tendo por isso os olhos dos 193 Estados que compõem a ONU postos em Lisboa.

Esta conferência afigura-se como determinante, numa altura em que são exigidos aos nossos líderes compromissos ambiciosos, corajosos e que respondam com eficácia à crise provocada pela emergência climática e da biodiversidade. Portugal tem-se posicionado publicamente nos últimos anos como um dos países na linha da frente da conservação marinha e é agora necessário, mais do que nunca, que as palavras deem lugar aos atos.

No final de março, após alguns rumores sobre a possível extinção do Ministério do Mar – que investigadores e ONG consideraram dramática –, a nomeação do novo Governo trouxe algumas surpresas, entre as quais a fusão dos Ministérios da Economia e do Mar e a nomeação de António Costa e Silva como ministro destas áreas governativas. É agora esperado, de Costa e Silva e do restante Governo, enquanto anfitriões da conferência, que liderem os esforços internacionais no que toca à conservação do meio marinho e que inspirem os restantes membros da ONU a intensificar os seus próprios esforços.

Todos dependemos do bom estado ambiental do oceano e dos serviços (tantas vezes invisíveis) que este nos presta: fonte de oxigénio, sumidouro de carbono, regulador da temperatura global, fonte de alimento e ainda de bem-estar e inspiração. O papel do oceano enquanto regulador do clima é cada vez mais evidente para todos aqueles que se preocupam com a crise climática e com as desigualdades sociais e económicas que ela gera. Sabemos que a estabilidade do sistema climático depende grandemente de um ambiente marinho saudável e, enquanto principais agressores do meio, é nossa função fazer mais. Não é necessário viver perto do mar para exigir dos nossos governantes mais e melhor, mas torna-se imperativo fazê-lo quando 97% do nosso território é mar.

Uma das múltiplas formas de fazer esse caminho passa por discutir pontos fulcrais que devem ser definidos como fora de limites para exploração comercial. Um exemplo paradigmático é o da mineração em mar profundo, que várias ONG por todo o mundo, apoiadas pela sociedade civil e por evidência científica, têm trazido para a discussão.

Existe atualmente consenso entre os investigadores dos ecossistemas de profundidade e alguns dos mais proeminentes comunicadores de ciência quanto à necessidade de implementar uma moratória de dez a 20 anos a esta atividade. As Fiji e o Território do Norte da Austrália, por exemplo, já implementaram uma moratória ou proibiram definitivamente esta atividade. Mais perto de nós, os parlamentos regionais das ilhas Canárias e da Galiza adotaram resoluções que pedem uma moratória nacional à mineração em mar profundo e, no passado mês de março, um novo decreto real definiu que a atividade de mineração em mar profundo fica sujeita à compatibilização com o princípio da precaução, o que, na prática, se traduz também numa moratória.

Em setembro, o congresso da União Internacional para a Conservação da Natureza (IUCN) votou de forma estrondosa a favor da moção que visa a proteção de ecossistemas oceânicos profundos e da sua biodiversidade através de uma moratória à mineração em mar profundo, tendo também tido o apoio do ICNF. A própria Comissão Europeia, na Estratégia da Biodiversidade para 2030, definiu que a mineração não deverá avançar “antes que os efeitos da mineração marinha no meio, na biodiversidade e nas atividades humanas sejam suficientemente investigados, os riscos sejam compreendidos e as tecnologias e práticas operacionais sejam capazes de demonstrar que não há nenhum dano sério no meio ambiente”.

É fundamental que Portugal se junte às vozes que apelam à precaução e à proteção de um dos ecossistemas mais frágeis e menos conhecidos do nosso planeta e assuma uma postura progressista, ao implementar uma moratória à mineração marinha em território nacional.

A Conferência dos Oceanos proporcionará ao nosso país a oportunidade perfeita para que se posicione de forma inequívoca do lado da proteção e da conservação dos ecossistemas marinhos. Anunciar a implementação de uma moratória à atividade de mineração será um muito necessário primeiro passo para inspirar outros países e dar ouvidos à sociedade contemporânea, e, sobretudo, à do futuro.

Lisbonne: le Maroc totalement engagé pour faire face aux défis liés à la protection des océans

MAP

Le Maroc est totalement engagé auprès de la communauté internationale pour faire face aux défis liés à la protection des océans, à la préservation de la biodiversité et aux changements climatiques, a affirmé, lundi à Lisbonne, le ministre de l'Agriculture, de la Pêche maritime, du Développement rural et des Eaux et Forêts, Mohamed Sadiki.

Cet engagement se confirme à travers l'adhésion du Royaume et sa ratification des instruments juridiques pertinents au milieu marin et son action constante pour le renforcement des cadres collaboratifs qui en découlent, a précisé Sadiki dans son allocution lors de la plénière d'ouverture de la Conférence des Nations Unies sur les Océans, qui se tient du 27 juin au 1er juillet 2022 dans la capitale portugaise, indique le ministère dans un communiqué.



""Fort de l'expérience réussie de plusieurs stratégies sectorielles, dont la stratégie Halieutis pour le développement du secteur halieutique lancée en 2009 et d'une recherche océanographique renforcée permettant une réelle surveillance océanographique et halieutique, le Maroc s’est engagé dans un programme ambitieux de développement de l’économie bleue, visant le renforcement de l’intégration de ses stratégies sectorielles maritimes autour d’une vision écosystémique inclusive, performante et innovante"", a soutenu le ministre.



Et en vue d’assurer un équilibre dans la gestion de son espace maritime, a poursuivi Sadiki, le Maroc a engagé un processus de planification spatiale maritime, visant l’accélération de l’émergence de véritables écosystèmes économiques maritimes en phase avec la politique nationale de régionalisation avancée qui érige le rôle crucial de la Région dans la réalisation du développement territorial durable.



En outre, le ministre a relevé que pour une meilleure efficacité de ces efforts, des actions complémentaires ont été mises en œuvre, telles que l’Initiative ""Ceinture bleue"" initiée par le Maroc à l’occasion de la COP22, la lutte contre la pollution marine et plastique, l’instauration des aires marines protégées, notant que le Maroc a par ailleurs promulgué une loi dédiée à la gestion de son littoral.



Conscient des enjeux environnementaux et de la responsabilité partagée de lutte contre les effets des changements climatiques, le Maroc a révisé à la hausse sa Contribution Déterminée au niveau National (NDC) avec l’ambition de réduire les émissions des gaz à effet de serre de 45,5 % à l’horizon de 2030.



Par ailleurs, Sadiki a fait remarquer que chaque jour qui passe sans action pour une protection effective des océans, le potentiel inestimable de croissance économique, de développement social et culturel que renferment les espaces marins se trouve compromis et la survie et le bien-être de l’humanité fragilisés.



Pour faire face à ces défis et inverser les tendances lourdes, la communauté internationale doit repenser son mode de développement, a-t-il insisté, ajoutant à cet égard, que l’économie bleue présente aujourd’hui une nouvelle opportunité qui s’inscrit parfaitement dans l’esprit de durabilité et de résilience prôné par l’agenda des Nations Unies pour le développement durable.""

Un projet non encouragé

Il y a quelques semaines, le Conseil des ministres seychellois a approuvé la signature d’un accord d’exploration pétrolière avec Adamantine Energy Ltd dans les eaux territoriales des Seychelles.

Lors d’une conférence de presse présidentielle, ce lundi 27 juin, le président Seychellois Wavel Ramkalawan revenu sur ce projet d’accord d’exploration pétrolière. Il a soutenu que la nation insulaire ne l’encourage pas. Selon ses dires, la protection de l’environnement et de l’océan reste essentielle pour les Seychelles.

La déclaration du président salué

Les commentaires du président Wavel Ramkalawan ont prêté confusion. Pour éclaircir les choses, le ministre seychellois chargé de la pêche et de l’économie bleue, Jean-François Ferrari, a indiqué que l’exploration pétrolière reste dans le champ de l’économie bleue et non dans la zone économique exclusive (ZEE) des Seychelles, déclarée zones marines protégées. ""Pour le moment, l’objectif principal est de découvrir ce que les Seychelles ont sous ses eaux"", a-t-il ajouté.

Le président de la Chambre de commerce et d’industrie des Seychelles (SCCI), Oliver Bastienne, a salué la déclaration du président Ramkalawan. ""Nous sommes heureux de voir que le gouvernement réfléchit sérieusement à la question et nous saluons l’idée d’utiliser cela comme un moyen pour le pays de pouvoir bénéficier de telles promesses"", a-t-il déclaré. En effet, la SCCI dit ne pas être opposée à une exploitation pétrolière. Cependant, elle doit s’assurer que cette dernière n’a pas d’impact négatif sur l’environnement et la pêche des Seychelles.

The signing of a petroleum exploration agreement with Adamantine Energy Ltd, which has its regional headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Ramkalawan told the press that the country is for the time being only encouraging oil exploration but protection of the environment and ocean remains key to the island nation.

His comments attracted attention and, therefore, further clarification was sought from the Minister responsible for fisheries and the Blue Economy, Jean-Francois Ferrari, who will be signing the agreement with Adamantine Energy.

Ferarri emphasised that the Blue Economy concept concerns the sustainable exploitation of ocean resources. Furthermore, 30 percent of Seychelles' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) has been declared as Marine Protected Areas. Oil exploration is, however, still within the scope of Blue Economy, if it is a sustainable form of exploitation of oceanic resources.

""It will give us a second option, where should the big nations not help us in finding and implementing green energy solutions, as they promised in big international conferences, then we will have no choice, but to drill for oil,"" said Minister Ferrari.

He added that for the time being though, the main focus is to find out what Seychelles has beneath its waters.

The chairperson of the Seychelles Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), Oliver Bastienne, has welcomed Ramkalawan's statement as he had written a letter to the president stating a number of concerns that need to be addressed especially given Seychelles' stance on the environment and ocean protection.

Bastienne said that ""we are happy to see that the government is reflecting hard on the matter and we do welcome the idea to use this as a means for the country to be able to benefit from such pledges.""

He added that SCCI is not completely opposed to the idea of oil exploitation but that careful consideration must be taken on the matter to ensure that it does not adversely impact the Seychelles' environment and fisheries.

Bastienne sent a working paper to the president on behalf of the SCCI, and among the concerns raised were the whole process, from exploration to exploitation and how this could have immense negative consequences for the natural and business environment.

(Dainise Quatre)

A park officer of the Sainte Anne Marine National Park, Dainise Quatre, is the first woman from Seychelles to receive a certificate of Marine Protected Area (MPA) Professionals.

Quatre received her certificate after following a four-day certification workshop in Kenya of the Western Indian Ocean Certification of Marine Protected Area Professionals (WIO-COMPAS) organised by the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA).

The certification programme took place from April 22 to 25 of this year, where 18 applicants sat for the various assessments, with 12 of them given their certification for level one.

""I am very proud to have received this certification and to be the first woman to achieve it. It is very special for me and I hope that it can encourage other women to take up a career in environment and protection of the marine park,"" Quatre told SNA.

Quatre has been working within the Seychelles Parks Gardens Authority (SPGA) for a number of years and recently completed her BSc in environmental science. The work she does is dominated by men, she says, but it has not fazed her as she has great support from her co-workers.

Quatre said: ""I am very proud to have received this certification and to be the first woman to achieve it."" (Dainise Quatre) Photo License: All Rights Reserved

She added that ""I really want to see more women join this job as despite being dominated by men, it does not mean women can't do it also.""

Quatre is the third Seychellois to achieve this certification. Two other Seychellois have the certification, namely the chief executive of the SPGA, Allen Cedras, and Ronny Renaud. Both have a level 2 certification.

The certification is a voluntary process that demonstrates a practitioner of the MPA's commitment to meeting a higher standard. It focuses on seven core competence areas in which MPA professionals need to meet certain standards of skills and knowledge.

""It was a really tough process as we had to prepare beforehand and face various quizzes, interviews and evaluations of our competencies in order to pass and be certified,"" said Quatre, who leads the Sainte Anne Marine Park team at the SPGA.

She explained that protecting these areas is crucial as it not only provides a benefit for food security but also for economic activities.",en,"Seychelles, Kenya","the Western Indian Ocean Certification of Marine Protected Area Professionals, the Seychelles Parks Gardens Authority, WIOMSA, SPGA, the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association, SNA","Dainise Quatre, Allen Cedras, Ronny Renaud","quatre, certification, marine, seychelles, spga, park, area, dainise, woman, mpa"

La signature d'un accord d'exploration pétrolière avec Adamantine Energy Ltd, dont le siège régional est à Nairobi, au Kenya, a été approuvée par le Conseil des ministres.

M. Ramkalawan a déclaré à la presse que le pays n'encourage pour le moment que l'exploration pétrolière, mais que la protection de l'environnement et de l'océan reste essentielle pour la nation insulaire.

Ses commentaires ont attiré l'attention et, par conséquent, des éclaircissements supplémentaires ont été demandés au ministre chargé de la pêche et de l'économie bleue, Jean-François Ferrari, qui signera l'accord avec Adamantine Energy.

M. Ferarri a souligné que le concept d'économie bleue concerne l'exploitation durable des ressources océaniques. En outre, 30 % de la zone économique exclusive (ZEE) des Seychelles ont été déclarées zones marines protégées. L'exploration pétrolière reste cependant dans le champ de l'économie bleue, s'il s'agit d'une forme durable d'exploitation des ressources océaniques.

""Cela nous donnera une deuxième option, où si les grandes nations ne nous aident pas à trouver et à mettre en œuvre des solutions d'énergie verte, comme elles l'ont promis lors de grandes conférences internationales, alors nous n'aurons pas d'autre choix que de forer pour le pétrole"", a déclaré le ministre Ferrari.

Il a ajouté que pour le moment, l'objectif principal est de découvrir ce que les Seychelles ont sous ses eaux.

Le président de la Chambre de commerce et d'industrie des Seychelles (SCCI), Oliver Bastienne, a salué la déclaration de M. Ramkalawan car il avait écrit une lettre au président indiquant un certain nombre de préoccupations devant être traitées, en particulier compte tenu de la position des Seychelles sur l'environnement et la protection de l'océan.

M. Bastienne a déclaré que ""nous sommes heureux de voir que le gouvernement réfléchit sérieusement à la question et nous saluons l'idée d'utiliser cela comme un moyen pour le pays de pouvoir bénéficier de telles promesses"".

Il a ajouté que la SCCI n'est pas complètement opposée à l'idée de l'exploitation pétrolière, mais qu'une attention particulière doit être accordée à la question pour s'assurer qu'elle n'a pas d'impact négatif sur l'environnement et la pêche des Seychelles.

M. Bastienne a envoyé un document de travail au président au nom de la SCCI, et parmi les préoccupations soulevées figuraient l'ensemble du processus, de l'exploration à l'exploitation et comment cela pourrait avoir d'immenses conséquences négatives pour l'environnement naturel et commercial.

""Le SCCI est d'avis que l'exploration, le forage et d'autres activités associées ne devraient pas être entrepris à proximité d'une zone touristique, y compris les stations balnéaires haut de gamme et à forte intensité d'investissement"", a ajouté M. Bastienne.

""In fact, the same applies to all people, even those from landlocked States"", Vivian noted on the importance of the ocean on people's livelihoods, as well as on the climate and marine biodiversity.

In his speech, Vivian highlighted that the theme of this year's conference, which is ""Scaling up Ocean Action Based on Science and Innovation"", is ""timely and salient"".

He urged UN member states to ""urgently scale up actions to collectively protect the ocean, and mitigate the impacts of climate change"".

These actions, Vivian added, must be conducted under the aegis of international law, based on data and science, and approached with multilateral cooperation as the foundation of the efforts.

To play its part, Singapore is renewing 10 of the voluntary commitments it had previously submitted to the UNOC and will undertake nine new ones.

What is a voluntary commitment?

The UNOC brings together UN member states to promote the implementation of Goal 14 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), which aims for the conservation and sustainable use of ocean, sea and marine resources.

The first UNOC was held back in 2017.

As part of the UNOC, voluntary commitments were launched to allow governments, organisations or individuals to undertake initiatives that support the implementation of Goal 14.

Once a voluntary commitment is submitted to the UNOC, its progress can be tracked in an online registry on the UNOC website.

Why does Singapore care?

According to the MFA webpage on UN SDGs, the UN SDGs is a ""global development framework"" that was adopted by World Leaders at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015.

Made up of 17 goals, they apply to all countries and is meant to gather efforts to ""end poverty, fight inequalities, and tackle climate change.""

""As a small country with limited land and no natural resources, Singapore understands the challenges of sustainable development well"", the website adds.

Singapore has submitted a total of 33 UNOC commitments since 2017, including the nine new commitments, according to Eco-Business.

Research projects amongst new initiatives

Of the nine new commitments, Vivian highlighted three of them, which are environmental research projects that will help enhance our understanding of the ocean.

The projects focus on the sustainable management of marine fish populations, studying the use of solar energy to facilitate coral growth, and a Marine Climate Change Science programme.

Adding to these, Vivian shared about Singapore’s efforts in the shipping industry to spearhead the transition to environmentally-friendly fuel, adopt greener and more energy-efficient technology, and build capacity for industry-specific carbon accounting.

Currently, Singapore’s other commitments include courses to be conducted this year on the International Law of the Sea, Managing Coastal Biodiversity under Urbanisation Pressures and Environmental Conservation and Sustainability.

These will be conducted through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, which shares Singapore's development experiences with other developing countries through training programmes.

The country has 41 marine protected areas.

Marine Protected Areas Day was celebrated on 1 August, and global support for the day is growing.

More than 5% of South Africa's marine areas are protected, but the country still has a long way to go to meet its international obligations, according to conservationists.

South Africa has 41 marine protected areas (MPAs) which make up only 5.4% of the ocean and coast.

These areas are similar to game reserves that protect land animals and plants, but they protect inhabitants of the ocean and threatened species instead. They also counteract overfishing by protecting spawning and nursery areas, ensuring that marine life have a safe haven in which to mature to adulthood.

On Monday, the second annual MPA Day took place. The national event was set to ""go global"", according to the executive of strategic projects of the Two Oceans Aquarium Education Foundation, Dr Judy Mann.

She said:

We are very excited about this year's MPA Day, which will be celebrated across the world.

But, while conservationists celebrate achievements to protect the ocean, there is still much more that needs to be done.

ANALYSIS | Protected marine areas should serve nature and people: A review of South Africa’s efforts

Senior manager of WWF South Africa's Marine Programme, Craig Smith, said South Africa made an international commitment to protect at least 10% of its marine areas. It is hoped that this will increase to more than 20% by 2037, as South Africa reviews legislation and targets around protected wildlife spaces.

South Africa increased its amount of protected coastline from less than 1%, to more than 5% in 2019.

""MPAs are very important. You can think of them as a safeguard to poor fishery management. When fish management hasn't got it quite right, MPAs act as a buffer that allows fish an area where they are protected and can replenish fisheries. MPAs provide an opportunity for us to repair vulnerable ecosystems,"" Smith added.

SA Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (Sanccob) head of conservation, Nicky Stander, said less than 0.1% of global oceans were formally protected in MPAs, compared to some 10% of local terrestrial ecosystems.

According to Stander, MPAs are critical for long-term conservation aims of SA's oceans and are also essential for the protection of the country's endangered African penguins.

""African penguins are classified as an endangered species, due to several threats. However, the primary reason for their demise is the lack of available prey, which is sardine and anchovy. Key breeding colonies have been declared MPAs. These MPAs are beneficial to African penguins by protecting their immediate foraging grounds,"" Stander said.

Stander believes that for MPAs to be truly effective, the government will need to increase surveillance and monitoring of oceans locally.

By March last year, only 7% of the world's coast had been designated or proposed as MPAs internationally.

""South Africa is not doing badly in the international context. We're working toward 10%,"" Mann said.

Smith added:

South Africa is not the worst in terms of marine protection, but it's also not the best. The country has committed internationally to achieving 10%, so we're [halfway there].

But new research showed that 10% might not be enough, Smith added.

""We need to think more along the lines of 30% of our coastline either fully protected or better managed,"" he said.

Mann said:

Not many countries are doing well in protecting 30% of their oceans, but that' s not to say people aren't trying. MPAs used to be a nice-to-have. But now we know that they are essential tools in our conservation toolbox.

Some neighbouring countries, such as Namibia and Mozambique, are working to achieve the 30% target by 2030. Other countries, such as Seychelles, have already surpassed that.



According to the Marine Conservation Institute's Marine Protection Atlas, 33% of Seychelles' coastline has been designated as a protected area.

To reach the 30% goal, careful thought will have to be given to where to place the MPAs, and how to integrate them with the communities that live around them, and to ensure that they are effective, Mann said.

But simply declaring an area as an MPA is not enough, she added.

The areas need adequate management plans and implementation, dedicated financial resources and skilled people to oversee projects. There also needs to be increased public support and awareness of the value MPAs provide.",en,"Namibia, South Africa’s, South Africa, Seychelles, SA, Mozambique, South Africa's","the Marine Conservation Institute's, SA, Sanccob, Marine Programme, the Two Oceans Aquarium Education Foundation, WWF","Judy Mann, Nicky Stander, Craig Smith","marine, mpas, south, africa, areas, protection, oceans, conservation, international, country"

The Blue Rebels formed an artistic invocation for government to increase ocean protection. The XR Cape Town group urged government to participate in ocean protection projects such as the 30x30 project, which called on leaders to support the goal of protecting at least 30% of the world’s land and sea by 2030.

XR Cape Town spokesperson Judy Scott-Goldman said the Blue Rebels were a quiet yet potent reminder of the beauty and inherent worth of the ocean, a visual representation of its fragility and the precarious life balance that it fostered. “The demonstration action was a simple ‘story’ where five Blue Rebels/water beings walk along the beach, stopping now and then to use gestures to express their awe and respect for the ocean. “They come across an apparently dead mermaid lying trapped in a net surrounded by pieces of plastic. The Rebels are distressed. They pull back the netting and try to revive the mermaid with gentle caresses – but to no avail. Eventually, they withdraw in great sadness and process off,” Scott-Goldman said.

She said ‘mermaids’ were mythological half human, half fish creatures and so represented the inter-relationship between the human and non-human world. For World Oceans Day, members of Extinction Rebellion (XR) Cape Town’s performance group, the Blue Rebels, staged a performance on Muizenberg Beach to draw attention to all the threats facing the oceans. Picture: Shannon Goodman/XR CAPE TOWN The group named multiple issues that pressured the lifegiving capacity of the ocean such as pollution from plastic, oil, agricultural waste and sound, ocean acidification and overfishing. “These issues represent a frightening threat to life on earth. If the ocean continues to heat, acidify, choke on pollution and buckle under pressure from overfishing, the results will be mass extinction, food insecurity and starvation, and a hotter, more polluted atmosphere in which survival is unlikely,” Scott-Goldman said.

CapeNature general manger Petro van Rhyn said the theme for World Oceans Day this year, ‘Revitalisation, collective action for the ocean’, highlighted the importance of getting involved in protecting and conserving marine resources. “Currently only 5% of South African marine and coastal areas are part of Marine Protected Areas but there is a global drive to protect at least 30% of land and ocean by 2030,” van Rhyn said.

428,2022-07-11,South Africa to increase ocean protection to 10%,https://thegreentimes.co.za/south-africa-to-increase-ocean-protection-to-10/,0,0,0,0,thegreentimes.co.za,South Africa,"There was much celebration in 2019 when the South African Marine Protected Area (MPA) network expanded to 41 MPAs encompassing 5.4% of its mainland waters, and the hope is that our country will celebrate again soon with a shift of our MPA footprint to 10%.

A key step in this conservation planning process is the production of the Critical Biodiversity Areas (CBA) Map, not a small feat – which was released in April 2022 by the Department of Forestry Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE), the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) and Nelson Mandela University.

The CBA Map informs protection and management and pulls the marine biodiversity sector’s strategy (and South Africa’s Ocean) into one place in a visual way. The primary purpose of this process is to ensure that marine life and ecological infrastructure are protected, as well as to make sure that the oceans economy (all the activities that take place in our ocean – fishing, oil and gas prospecting, transport, tourism etc) is implemented in a sustainable manner.

The creation of this map is a very collaborative and data hungry process, produced by including datasets in a computer model with data submissions from all sectors around South Africa including government, NGOs, and private enterprises with 976 biodiversity features and design elements included.

The map highlights ecosystem types; important areas and distributions of species such as turtles, seabirds, whales, seals, sharks, and rays; unique or special habitats or features; ecological processes; ecological infrastructure and existing priority areas for protection. Design elements include edge matching and aligning priority areas both locally and internationally, culturally important areas, ecological condition, and climate change adaptation. In addition, the dataset includes cost layers, which are areas to be avoided to reduce conflict (around 19 different sectors including fisheries, aquaculture, petroleum, mining, and transport) and considerations linked to cumulative impact of past and current activities.

“This means that the CBA Map is the most effective way to protect our biodiversity, while reducing conflict with industry,” said MPA Scientist at WILDTRUST, Kendyl Wright.

This version of the CBA Map has identified areas of important biodiversity and zones them to include Critical Biodiversity Areas “Natural (18%) and Restore (3.6%)” which must be either maintained or restored to a natural or near natural state, and “Ecological Support Areas (6.6%)” which must be kept in a functional state. These areas together with the 5.4% MPAs identify 33.6% of our ocean space around South Africa as biodiversity prioritization areas and inform MPA expansion in the future. These areas are also assigned management recommendations which are outlined in the sea use guidelines.

“Within our existing MPA network of 5.4%, South Africa’s coastal zone is well represented, with just under 37% of the coast falling within MPAs,” says Wright.

“While there are still critical coastal areas, it is offshore regions that comprise those low hanging fruit in the potential ‘next 5% MPAs’ where the benefits to the people of South Africa significantly outweigh the immediate costs. These include key areas identified during the Phakisa and CBA Map process but left unprotected on the west coast such as an expanded area around the Orange Shelf MPA. It is certainly clear that the science and planning groundwork to achieve spatial protection targets has been done, and that we are ready to take the next step in our journey to achieve 10% protection of our mainland waters.”

South Africa finalised V1.2 of its CBA Map in April 2022, although this is an iterative process with updates likely as data improves. This indicates key areas that require protection, and the prediction is that much of this next 5% MPAs will be offshore where the value to the people of South Africa through carbon sequestration, food security and oxygen provision far outweigh any negatives.

This means that South Africa is poised and ready to achieve 10% of our ocean in MPAs and this will go a long way to contributing our lions share towards the global 30×30 goal – currently being referred to as the 30% before 2030 goal at the United Nations Ocean Conference currently taking place in Portugal.

Earlier this year President Cyril Ramaphosa publicly announced South Africa’s support of the global 30×30 goal saying: “South Africa supports and welcomes all targets in the Global Biodiversity Framework and recognises the need for ambitious targets, including for Target 3, which is commonly known as 30×30.” *

“Over-fishing, damaging industrial activities, habitat destruction, resource extraction, climate change and pollution are not letting up and by not protecting our oceans’ ability to keep giving what we take, we risk a biodiversity crisis, and a subsequent ocean collapse and economic catastrophe,” commented Wright.

“You can help by adding your name to this online appeal for increased protection.

Protecting our Ocean will not only benefit biodiversity but also our South African people.

""Hoy es muy buen día para la conservación de los océanos, pero también para la Humanidad”, afirmó en la ceremonia el presidente de Chile, Gabriel Boric, el impulsor de una iniciativa que forma parte de la ""diplomacia turquesa” que defiende.

Uno detrás de otro, firmaron el documento Boric, sus colegas de Colombia, Iván Duque; Perú, José Pedro Castillo; Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves; Ecuador, Guillermo Lasso, y Panamá, Laurentino Cortiz, así como los jefes de la diplomacia de Canadá, Mélanie Joly, y de México, Marcelo Ebrard, y el encargado de asuntos de clima de EE.UU., John Kerry.

Iniciativa de Chile en respaldo a los Acuerdos de París

La iniciativa lanzada hoy, afirmó Boric, respaldaba los compromisos asumidos en los Acuerdos de París, y para defenderlos los países signatarios se colocaron ""en la primera fila” para cumplirlos.

La idea, agregó el presidente chileno, era amarrar un compromiso ""con tres de las grandes crisis que afectan al mundo”, que son el cambio climático, la pérdida de la biodiversidad y el deterioro de los océanos.

""Vamos a trabajar por el establecimiento de una serie de áreas marinas protegidas que van a estar ecológicamente interconectadas, avanzando hacia estrategias regionales para la conservación de los océanos”, manifestó el presidente chileno.

La ONU avisa desde hace décadas del deterioro progresivo de los océanos por problemas viejos, como la pesca sin control, y de otros más recientes, como los microplásticos derivados de la basura que llega a los mares.

Desde que Naciones Unidas comenzó a alertar de este tema, a mediados de la década pasada, ya denunció que cerca de ocho millones de toneladas de plástico llegan cada año a los mares del Planeta y muchos de ellos son consumidos por los peces que alimentan a los humanos.

Pero Duque, a su turno, también alertó sobre otros dos efectos graves del deterioro de los océanos: la destrucción de los arrecifes coralinos y ""prácticas tan deleznables como la pesca de arrastre”.

Los nueve instan a China, Rusia, la India o la Unión Europea a unirse

""Los océanos son los principales sumideros naturales de carbono y como tales tienen un papel crucial frente a los efectos del cambio climático”, dijo Boric.

El pacto firmado hoy vincula a los países americanos con la mayor dependencia del Pacífico, pero también es una llamada de atención a otras regiones o países, como China, Rusia, la India o la Unión Europea, citados por Boric, con el fin de que se vinculen a estos mismos esfuerzos.

""Sabemos que la crisis climática no reconoce fronteras, y por eso tenemos que dar pasos concretos”, insistió Boric.

431,2022-05-24,Una nave-giardino in Cina per parlare di sostenibilità e protezione degli oceani - Daily Nautica,https://www.dailynautica.com/ambiente/una-nave-giardino-in-cina-per-parlare-di-sostenibilita-e-protezione-degli-oceani/93646/,45,45,0,0,dailynautica.com,Spain,"Può un giardino stimolare riflessioni sulla protezione degli oceani e sull’importanza delle risorse idriche? Sì, se quel giardino-foresta è stato realizzato all’interno di una nave. È questo il suggestivo progetto con cui le architette Lorenza Bartolazzi e Claudia Clementini hanno deciso di declinare il tema della sostenibilità e del rispetto dell’ambiente allo Shenzhen Garden Festival 2022, tenutosi pochi mesi fa in Cina.

“Abbiamo voluto realizzare un giardino – spiega Lorenza Bartolazzi a Daily Nautica- che colpisse l’immaginazione dei visitatori e che facesse riflettere sui temi della sostenibilità”. Ciò che ne è venuto fuori è una suggestiva installazione che, suscitando meraviglia, conduce a meditare sulla fragilità del nostro ecosistema ma anche sulla potenza e la potenzialità della natura. “La sostenibilità per noi era centrale – sottolinea Lorenza Bartolazzi– e siamo partite dall’acqua, un tema fondamentale per il nostro pianeta“.

Edith Cavell: la barca isola

La scintilla per realizzare la suggestiva installazione che connette terra e acqua è arrivata alle due architette dalla scoperta di un vero e proprio monumento naturale che prende il nome di Edith Cavell, detta anche la “barca isola”. Una nave mercantile britannica partita nel 1924 da Marsiglia alla volta di Fort de France e naufragata a Saint Laurent du Maroni, nella Guyana francese, lungo il fiume Maroni.

Ogni sforzo per rimuovere il piroscafo è stato vano. Così Edith Cavell, dopo aver trasportato viveri e rifornimenti, è finita per accogliere un carico verde vivo e rigoglioso, emblema della potenza della natura, divenendo una sorta di isolotto all’interno del fiume, visibile tutt’oggi.

“Siamo rimaste colpite – racconta l’architetto Bartolazzi – dal fenomeno che si è prodotto in questo cargo. Nell’Edith Cavell erano stati trasportati dei viveri. Ciò ha fatto sì che si creassero le condizioni per le quali vi nascesse della vegetazione che è poi diventata rigogliosissima, come una foresta. Abbiamo così deciso di riproporre questa idea nel garden show”.

Dall’idea alla realizzazione

A dare vita al progetto delle due architette italiane, ideato per l’Hongyue Horticultural Corporation, organizzatore della manifestazione, ci ha pensato Michael Zhao. Prima di tutto è stato acquistato un peschereccio. Era importante infatti, che l’imbarcazione, per rimanere in tema di sostenibilità, fosse di recupero. All’interno del peschereccio (smontato e riassemblato) è poi stato inserito un atollo di piante, ad evocare la potenza della natura manifestatasi su Edith Cavell. Una vera e propria foresta galleggiante composta da piante provenienti da tutto il mondo.

“Sul peschereccio – ricorda Lorenza Bartolazzi – è stato installato qualche cosa che ricordasse una foresta primordiale, ma l’idea era anche che fosse un po’ come un’arca che raccogliesse piante che provenissero da tutto il mondo e se possibile, anche in via di estinzione“.

L’installazione temporanea, nell’idea di Lorenza Bartolazzi e della sua collega Claudia Clementini doveva essere di circa 20 metri per 10, ma in realtà è finita per essere molto più grande. I realizzatori, infatti, rimasti entusiasti dal progetto, hanno deciso di riprodurre alle spalle dell’imbarcazione anche un paesaggio lacustre. Con la loro suggestiva installazione Lorenza Bartolazzi e la sua collega Claudia Clementini si sono aggiudicate allo Shenzhen Garden Festival il premio Best in Show.

432,2022-03-07,Greenpeace exige la protección del océano frente a su industrialización con un Tratado Global de los Océanos,https://www.europapress.es/sociedad/medio-ambiente-00647/noticia-greenpeace-exige-proteccion-oceano-frente-industrializacion-tratado-global-oceanos-20220307124922.html,23,21,2,0,europapress.es,Spain,"MADRID, 7 Mar. (EUROPA PRESS) -

Greenpeace reclama la protección de los océanos de su actual ""industrialización"" a través de un Tratado Global de los Océanos que proteja al menos el 30% de todas sus aguas y que está en la cuarta y última ronda de negociación en Naciones Unidas.

La ONG lleva años reclamando un Tratado Global de los mares y con motivo del inicio de las negociaciones en la ONU este lunes --se prolongarán hasta el 18 de marzo-- ha publicado un informe en el que denuncia la ""pesquería sin control del calamar"" y que calcula que se ha multiplicado por diez desde 1950.

El informe 'El calamar en el punto de mira: Receta para el desastre', afirma que el calamar es una especie vital y su pesca se ha multiplicado hasta los casi 5 millones de toneladas anuales en la última décadas.

Además, denuncia que la pesquería del calamar opera fuera de la vista, en aguas internacionales y ha experimentado un ""ascenso meteórico"" debido a una demanda que ""no tiene precedentes históricos"". De hecho, afirma que en algunas zona ha crecido un 800 por ciento el número de barcos en los últimos cinco años.

El documento afirma que flotas de más de 500 embarcaciones han accedido a las aguas internacionales para ""saquear el océano"", con sus lámparas encendidas para faenar visibles desde el espacio. ""He visto algunas de estas flotas de calamares en mar abierto; por la noche, los barcos están iluminados como estadios de fútbol y parece que el mar es un polígono industrial"", ha declarado la responsable de Océanos de Greenpeace España, Pilar Marcos.

Marcos alerta de que los océanos se están industrializando y que más allá de las aguas nacionales la situación es ""una batalla campal"" ante una falta de control que es un ""claro ejemplo"" de por qué están fallando las normas actuales para proteger los océanos.

""Es una visión inquietante que nunca voy a olvidar. Pero aunque esto esté sucediendo fuera del punto de mira no significa que deba estar fuera de nuestro conocimiento"", subraya Pilar Marcos.

Por ello, considera que esta conferencia sobre los océanos es ""demasiado importante para que se quede en un mero debate"" y exige medidas urgentes par proteger el ecosistema más grande de la Tierra.

""Todos dependemos de los océanos, lo sepamos o no: para ayudar a abordar el cambio climático, garantizar ecosistemas sanos y garantizar la seguridad alimentaria y los medios de subsistencia para millones de personas en todo el mundo. Necesitamos urgentemente un Tratado Global de los Océanos ambicioso que nos permita crear una red de santuarios oceánicos en todo el mundo y poner freno a la creciente industrialización de nuestros bienes comunes globales"", insiste Marcos, que forma parte de la delegación de Greenpeace de las negociaciones de la ONU.

La importancia del calamar es ""vital"" porque su sobrepesca representa una ""seria amenaza para todo el ecosistema, incluidas las poblaciones vulnerables de ballenas y delfines"". De ese modo, añade que su disminución tendría ""consecuencias catastróficas para la vida marina y las comunidades costeras que dependen de la pesca para su sustento y seguridad alimentaria"".

En la actualidad no hay un sistema regulatorio y monitorización específicos para seguir el comercio global del calamar. Según datos de la organización, en 2019, sólo tres naciones pesqueras fueron responsables de casi el 60 por ciento de la captura mundial de calamar, China continental, Perú e Indonesia. Y solo tres mercados (China continental, España y Japón) lideraron la mayoría de los movimientos del mercado global entre 2000 y 2019.

La ONU acoge desde hoy hasta el 18 de marzo las reuniones para negociar un Tratado Global de los Océanos. La petición de Greenpeace ha sido respaldada por casi 5 millones de personas, que apuestan por la creación de una red de santuarios oceánicos (áreas libres de actividad humana dañina) en al menos un tercio de los océanos del mundo para 2030.

Greenpeace considera que estas negociaciones son una ""oportunidad histórica"" para cambiar la gobernanza de los océanos que no reemplazará a las Organizaciones Regionales de Ordenación Pesquera, competentes para gestionar la pesquería de calamar, pero valora que completará y fortalecerá su trabajo para garantizar la sostenibilidad y la salud integral de los ecosistemas al llenar los vacíos y mejorar la cooperación entre los órganos de gestión responsables de la regulación de actividades específicas en alta mar.",es,"China, España, Perú, MADRID, Indonesia, Japón","EUROPA PRESS, Naciones Unidas, Océanos de, Greenpeace, ONU, un Tratado Global de los mares, China continental, las Organizaciones Regionales de Ordenación Pesquera, un Tratado Global de los Océanos, ONG",Pilar Marcos,"océanos, calamar, global, los, greenpeace, tratado, mar, marcos, industrialización, la"

Over the last decade, Samsung Electronics has worked to reimagine product design and development to do more with less when it comes to the planet’s natural resources.



Samsung’s latest step in this mission was the recent creation of a Galaxy technology that repurposes one of the world’s main sources of plastic waste — discarded fishing nets.



Discarded fishing nets pose serious threats to marine life and natural ecosystems, often ending up in people’s food and water sources.



Due to long-term exposure to seawater and UV rays, fishing net material is fragile, making the nets difficult to upcycle directly.



To find a solution, Samsung created a material that maintains the quality of its smartphones while preserving the health of the world’s oceans.



Samsung believes collaboration is crucial to breaking barriers and creating innovations that bring both performance and sustainability.



Therefore, Samsung joined forces with likeminded organizations to evolve new capabilities and address the complex challenge of ocean plastic pollution.



Samsung first partnered with Royal DSM, a leading science-based company to gather fishing nets from fishers who collect them along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean.



After ensuring collection of the nets, the company separates, cuts, cleans and extrudes them to develop an eco-conscious material, which consists of a minimum of 80% recycled polyamide, or nylon.



Samsung then collaborates with Hanwha Compound, a polymer compounding company to optimize the material’s performance to match the company’s high-quality standards for smartphone technology.



The material is transformed into high-performance polyamide resins that are constructed with a minimum of 20% repurposed fishing nets.



Now ready for use in mobile technology, Samsung incorporated these upcycled polyamide resins into key components of the Galaxy S22 series’ key bracket and inner cover of the S Pen.



This is only the beginning.



Samsung is committed to evolving and expanding its use of ocean-bound plastics across all its products.



By the end of 2022, Samsung’s use of recycled ocean-bound material could prevent more than 50 tons of discarded fishing nets1 from entering the world’s oceans.



The Galaxy S22 series marks another step in Samsung’s sustainability journey under Galaxy for the Planet, which aims to unleash the company’s scale, innovation and spirit of open collaboration to deliver tangible climate actions across the MX Business and enable Galaxy users to adopt more sustainable lifestyles.



This includes increasing its use of recycled materials, reducing standby power, eliminating single-use plastic from packaging and diverting all waste from landfills by 2025.



Samsung is committed to addressing ocean plastic pollution in a way that will positively impact not only the environment but also the lives of all Galaxy users.



This new technological advancement marks a notable achievement in the company’s journey to deliver tangible environmental actions and protect the planet for generations to come.

1. Martina Munz: Kosmetik-, Wasch- und Reinigungsprodukte

Die SP-Politikerin reichte im Mai eine Motion ein, die einen konkreten Aktionsplan zur Verminderung und Vermeidung von Mikroplastik in unseren Gewässern verlangt. Sie bezieht sich dabei insbesondere auf Mikroplastikkügelchen in Kosmetika sowie auf gelöste Kunststoffe (Polymere). Es freut uns sehr, dass Frau Munz in ihrer Motion das Vorsorgeprinzip erwähnt. Dieses besagt, dass potenzielle Umweltschäden im Voraus vermieden werden sollen. Sie greift damit die Tatsache auf, dass noch keine wissenschaftlichen Studien über die Konsequenzen von gelösten Polymeren in den Gewässern vorliegen. Dies darf aber kein Hinderungsgrund sein, um die Umwelt vor menschgemachten Gefahren zu schützen.

2. Balthasar Glättli: Textilfasern

Im Juni lancierte Balthasar Glättli von der Grünen Partei eine Motion zum Thema Textilfasern. Die Motion bezieht sich sehr direkt auf unseren Petitionstext, in dem wir den gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Einbau von Mikroplastikfiltern in Waschmaschinen fordern. Herr Glättlis Motion konkretisiert die Forderung, indem er Branchenvereinbarungen im Sinne des Umweltschutzgesetzes ins Zentrum stellt und doppelt mit einer Forderung nach gesetzlichen Vorschriften nach, falls diese Branchenvereinbarungen das gewünschte Ziel nicht erreichen sollten.

3. Gabriela Suter: Reifenabrieb

In particularly sensitive and species-rich areas, all fishing is prohibited, while in others it is strictly controlled. In addition, mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, bottom trawling, and the use and transport of heavy oil are completely prohibited. Photo: Julia Hager

The marine protected area around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands is one of the largest in the world. It was established in 2012 to protect and conserve the rich marine wildlife in the region, including whales, seals, penguins and other seabirds, as well as their prey (fish and krill). Now, the British Antarctic Survey, together with the government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, has released a new data portal to help manage the marine protected area.

The new, open-access data portal contains comprehensive up-to-date information on ecology, environmental conditions, and human activities that is particularly relevant to managers, scientists, and stakeholders. For example, in addition to general information on the species, the respective statistics on breeding success or populations as well as maps showing the breeding colonies can be retrieved from the various seabird species. Similar data exist for the seals and penguins. For some species, even satellite data of their migrations are available.

Information is also available on bathymetry, currents, sea ice extent, and ocean surface temperature.

In total, the data portal contains over 150 interactive maps and data summaries linked directly to the online South Georgia GIS and the UK Polar Data Centre’s Discovery Metadata System. The portal is part of the project “Building Data Resources for SGSSI Marine Protected Area Management” undertaken by the British Antarctic Survey and the UK Polar Data Centre in collaboration with the Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.

The marine protected area covers 1.24 million square kilometers and contains several specially protected areas, such as “no-take zones” where fishing is completely prohibited. Map: British Antarctic Survey

“The new Data Portal highlights the enormous amount of scientific information and research effort that contributed to the designation of the MPA, and which continues to advance our understanding of the ecosystem and to ensure that it is protected into the future,” said Dr. Susie Grant, marine biogeographer at the British Antarctic Survey and leader of the project.

Jonathan Handley, Project Manager of the Marine Programme at BirdLife International adds, “It’s excellent to see this new Data Portal now live and available to stakeholders. It is an essential tool that has greatly contributed to the BirdLife International Marine Programmes’ ability to support identifying and monitoring a global network of important sites for bird species.”

In addition to the diverse information, the data portal also includes a research and monitoring plan for the Marine Protected Area to guide future scientific activities that will contribute to a better understanding of the marine ecosystem, assess the nature and extent of future changes, and provide information to evaluate the effectiveness of the marine protected area.

The MPA is reviewed every five years to ensure that protective measures continue to be effective and that the most current scientific knowledge is taken into account.

Jeudi, l’ONG Greenpeace a lancé un appel pour préserver les océans à l’échelle mondiale.

Pour préserver les océans, l’ONG Greenpeace demande de prendre des mesures fortes. AFP

La communauté internationale doit adopter un «traité fort» sur la protection des océans à l’horizon 2030, a réclamé l’ONG écologiste Greenpeace, jeudi, à Lisbonne, lors d’une action en marge d’une conférence des Nations unies consacrée au sujet.

«Nous avons besoin d’un traité fort sur les océans à l’échelle mondiale qui place leur protection au-dessus des profits et crée un réseau de sanctuaires océaniques», a déclaré aux médias Laura Meller, conseillère chez Greenpeace. «Nous sommes ici pour dire aux dirigeants mondiaux qui sont réunis ici à Lisbonne qu’il faut passer des paroles aux actes», a-t-elle ajouté.

Environ 7000 responsables politiques, experts et défenseurs de l’environnement venus de quelque 140 pays sont réunis cette semaine, dans la capitale portugaise, sous l’égide de l’ONU.

Nourrir débats

La conférence de Lisbonne n’est pas une séance de négociations formelles, mais viendra nourrir les débats prévus lors des deux sommets cruciaux qui se tiendront en fin d’année: la conférence de l’ONU sur le climat COP27 en novembre en Égypte, suivie en décembre par la très attendue conférence des Nations unies sur la biodiversité COP15, qui se déroulera au Canada sous présidence chinoise.

Avant ces rendez-vous, la prochaine échéance sera fin août, à New York, pour une nouvelle séance de négociations sur un traité de protection de la biodiversité en haute mer, soit au-delà des zones de juridiction nationales. Alors que moins de 10% des océans du monde sont actuellement protégés, 100 pays ont rejoint une coalition préconisant de réserver 30% de la surface terrestre et océanique de la planète à des zones protégées d’ici 2030.

Cette initiative pourrait être la pierre angulaire d’un traité qui devrait être finalisé lors du sommet sur la biodiversité de Montréal, en décembre. Elle est soutenue par les États-Unis, les pays de l’Union européenne, le Mexique, le Canada, le Japon et l’Inde, mais la Chine, la Russie, l’Indonésie et le Brésil ne l’ont pas encore rejointe.",fr,"Lisbonne, Égypte, Canada, le Mexique, New York, Japon, Russie","les États-Unis, Brésil, Greenpeace, conférence des Nations unies, l’ONG Greenpeace, AFP",Laura Meller,"greenpeace, traité, océans, protection, fort, conférence, l’ong, lisbonne, pays, biodiversité"

La réplique d’une excavatrice des fonds marins a été installée mercredi matin sur la Place fédérale pour exiger la protection des océans. Par cette action, Greenpeace souhaitait attirer l’attention sur les risques liés à l’exploitation minière en eaux profondes.

Quatorze militants ont commencé à installer avant le lever du jour l’excavatrice de six mètres de long, cinq mètres de haut et 2,5 mètres de large. La police a mis fin à l’action un peu plus tard, a constaté un photographe de Keystone-ATS.

Alors que la réplique pesait quatre tonnes, le véritable engin pèse cent fois plus. Il sert à extraire à plus de 4000 mètres de profondeur des nodules polymétalliques, qui contiennent entre autres du manganèse, du cobalt et du nickel.

La police est venue mettre fin à l’action de Greenpeace sur la Place fédérale mercredi matin. KEYSTONE/MARCEL BIERI

Lancer une industrie extractive dans des écosystèmes encore intacts aurait des conséquences «catastrophiques» pour la biodiversité des océans, explique Greenpeace dans un communiqué. Le Conseil fédéral doit donc s’engager pour un moratoire sur une telle exploitation minière.

De grands groupes actifs dans les matières premières, dont des entreprises suisses, font pression sur l’Autorité internationale des fonds marins (ISA) pour avoir le droit d’exploiter les fonds marins, pointe l’ONG. Selon elle, les premières licences d’exploitation seraient autorisées dès 2023 et une entreprise fribourgeoise prévoirait déjà des expéditions tests.

Accord «ambitieux»

Greenpeace demande aussi que le gouvernement œuvre en faveur d’un accord «ambitieux» pour la protection de la haute mer. Depuis 2017, l’ONU discute d’un accord international en la matière. Les négociations finales auront lieu à New York en mars.

La Suisse y prendra part. Mais le Conseil fédéral n’a toujours pas de position claire à ce sujet, déplore l’ONG. Il ne montre pas non plus d’engagement clair en faveur de zones marines protégées sans exploitation humaine, ni en faveur d’une réglementation stricte de toutes les formes d’exploitation en dehors des zones marines protégées, constate-t-elle.

Das ultimative Naturparadies liegt weit abgeschieden von moderner Zivilisation inmitten zahlloser, unbewohnter Inseln und den artenreichsten Korallenriffen der Welt. Die idyllische Insel, vormals ein Camp von Haifischjägern, ist nun ein unvergleichliches Reiseerlebnis für Schnorchler und Taucher. Ein visionäres Projekt, dass sich seit 2005 ganzheitlich dem Erhalt der Natur und insbesondere dem Meeresschutz verschrieben hat. Die Gründung der eigenen Stiftung - Misool Foundation - hat 2011 den Weg bereitet für umfangreiche, nachhaltige Erfolge. Im Zentrum von Misool steht die Mission, die Zukunft der Riffe und der von ihnen abhängigen Bevölkerung zu sichern. Das Misool Marine Reserve umfasst ein Gebiet von 300'000 Hektaren, deren Schutz eine 18-köpfige Patrouilleneinheit sicherstellt. Es beherbergt 75% aller weltweit bekannten Korallenarten, 1564 Arten von Rifffischen und ist ein sicherer Zufluchtsort für Schildkröten, Haie und Mantas. Seit der Einrichtung des Meeresschutzgebietes hat sich die Fisch-Biomasse um 250% erhöht, über 2300 Mantarochen wurden durch das Manta-Forschungsprojekt identifiziert und die Haipopulation ist 25mal höher als ausserhalb des Reservates.

Zudem werden fortlaufend Korallenriffe aufgeforstet, die zuvor durch Dynamitfischerei zerstört wurden. Die Sicherung einer intakten Flora und Fauna im Reservat gewährt lokalen Fischern erhöhte Fangmengen in ihren traditionellen Fischereigründen. Misool leitet eine Reihe von sozialen Entwicklungsprojekten. So werden die umliegenden Gemeinden über Müllvermeidung aufklärt, deren Abfälle aufgekauft und fürs Recycling aufbereitet. Seit 2014 wurden über 2000 Tonnen Abfall verarbeitet. Die 250 Mitarbeiter stammen mehrheitlich aus den umliegenden Dörfern, in welchen auch Englischunterricht und Jobtrainings organisiert werden. Der Hotelbetrieb ist bedacht, die Umwelt so wenig wie möglich zu belasten. Die Aspekte sind umfassend, reichen von lokaler Beschaffung von Lebensmittel über die Reduktion fossiler Brennstoffe durch Solarenergie bis hin zu diversen Massnahmen zur Minderung des Energieverbrauchs. Damit das Paradies seinen Reichtum bewahrt – und auch Sie ins Staunen versetzt. Mehr zum Misool Eco Resort bei Manta Reisen

Coco Palm Dhuni Kolhu, Malediven

Meeresschildkröten im Fokus Sie sind an den Riffen der Malediven zuhause und gehören zu den Lieblingen von Tauchern und Schnorchlern: Meeresschildkröten. Die anmutigen Geschöpfe unter Wasser bei der Futtersuche oder an der Oberfläche beim Luft holen zu beobachten, ist ein unvergessliches Erlebnis. Nähert man sich den Schildkröten vorsichtig und mit einer gesunden Distanz, lassen sie sich in ihrem Tun nicht stören. Zu Recht, denn menschliche Besucher sind für die Tiere meist ungefährlich. Ernsthaft sind sie in Gefahr, wenn sie sich in einem Netz verfangen. Um die Riffe des Inselarchipels driften viele über Bord geworfene oder verlorene Fischernetze, sogenannte Geisternetze. Fischen per Netz ist auf den Malediven verboten. So stammen die Geisternetze nicht zwingend aus dem Inselstaat, sondern wurden mit den Strömungen der Ozeane in die Atolle geschwemmt. Die Meeresschildkröten können sich kaum selbst mehr daraus lösen, verletzen sich bei einem Befreiungsversuch oder sterben sogar.

Hilfe für verletzte Tiere Das in England gegründete «Olive Ridley Project» setzt sich für den Schutz der Meeresschildkröten im Indischen Ozean ein. Seit ein paar Jahren betreibt die Organisation ein Pflegezentrum für verletzte Meeresschildkröten auf der Insel Coco Palm Dhuni Kolhu. Mittlerweile werden verletzte Schildkröten aus den ganzen Malediven ins Resort im Baa-Atoll gebracht. In der Auffangstation kümmert sich eine Veterinärin zusammen mit einem Team von Freiwilligen um die Tiere. Sie verarztet und operiert die verletzen Schildkröten. Feriengäste der Insel sind willkommen, die Station zu besichtigen und bei einer Fütterung der Schildkröten dabei zu sein. Und wenn sie Glück haben, dürfen sie sogar miterleben, wie eine genesene Schildkröte zurück ins Meer entlassen wird. Ein wahrlich bewegendes Ereignis. Aufklärungsarbeit vor Ort Die Organisation hilft aber nicht nur verletzten Tieren, sondern führt auch Aufklärungsarbeit bei der lokalen Bevölkerung inklusive der Fischer durch. Sie organisiert zudem Reinigungsaktionen im Meer, bei welchen Geisternetze eingesammelt und an Land entsorgt werden. Dabei werden sie von vielen Resorts und deren Tauchbasen auf den ganzen Malediven unterstützt. Auch Manta Reisen spendet zusammen mit seinen Kunden jährlich einen Beitrag zum Schutz der Unterwasserwelt. Mehr zum Coco Palm Dhuni Kolhu bei Manta Reisen

Walbeobachtung, Island

Der Nordatlantik vor Island ist die Heimat für zahlreiche Walarten. Von Dezember bis Juni trifft man in Westisland vor der Halbinsel Snæfellsnes, die das EarthCheck-Zertifikat für nachhaltigen Tourismus erhalten hat, nicht selten Orcas an. Orcas sind soziale Tiere und bleiben ihr Leben lang bei ihrer Familie und bilden zusammen sogenannte Schulen oder Pods. Unser Partner Lakí Tours bietet als einziger Anbieter auf Snæfellsnes Walbeobachtungstouren an. Das Familienunternehmen ist mit kleinen Booten unterwegs und die Crewmitglieder haben ein grosses Know-how, welches sie auf den Touren gerne an die Gäste weitergeben. Lakí Tours hat IceWhale, den isländischen Verband für Walbeobachtungen, massgeblich bei der Erarbeitung des Verhaltenskodexes unterstützt. Dieser Verhaltenskodex stellt sicher, dass die Wale rund um Island, während den Walbeobachtungstouren nicht gestört werden.

Viele Mitarbeiter von Lakí Tours sind ebenfalls Mitglied der Non-Profit Organisation «Orca Guardians». Diese Vereinigung widmet sich dem Schutz der Orcas in Island und deren Lebensraum. So haben sich internationale Experten aus unterschiedlichen Bereichen (z.B. Meeresbiologie und Meeresschutz, Tourismus, Recht, Tier- und Umweltpsychologie sowie Fischerei und Zoologie) zusammengeschlossen, um die Orcas gemeinsam zu schützen und zu erforschen. Nebst regelmässigen Müllsammelaktionen an Stränden arbeitet Orca Guardians an einem «Orca ID» Projekt. Dieses hat zum Ziel, jeden einzelnen Orca zu fotografieren und die Tiere anhand ihrer einzigartigen Flossenform und Hautzeichnung zu unterscheiden. Diese Daten sind wichtig in der Forschung und helfen, den Schutz der Orcas zu verbessern. Während einer Walbeobachtungstour haben Sie als Gast die Möglichkeit, zusammen mit den Guides die Orcas zu fotografieren und so persönlich zum «Orca ID» Projekt beizutragen.

PONANT - Weg von Plastik

Die kleine aber feine französische Reederei ist mit ihren neuen, modernen kleinen Expeditionsschiffen vielfach in sehr abgeschiedenen und naturbelassenen Regionen der Welt unterwegs. Darum erstaunt es wenig, dass sich PONANT zum Ziel gesetzt hat, eine Vorbildfunktion in der Entwicklung zu mehr Nachhaltigkeit im Bereich Kreuzfahrten einzunehmen. Die Reederei setzt sich ambitiöse Ziele. Im Vergleich zu 2018 will PONANT bis 2023 den Einsatz von Einwegplastik um ganze 80% reduzieren. Plastikbecher, Röhrchen, Cocktailsticks oder Wäschesäcke wurden bereits aussortiert. Ein grosser Fortschritt sind ebenfalls die an Bord offerierten Wasserflaschen für Landausflüge. Diese sind mehrfach nutzbar und verteilt auf dem Schiff findet der Gast mehrere Auffüllstationen. Sollte dennoch Plastik entsorgt werden müssen, arbeitet man an Land mit ausgesuchten Recycling-Partnern zusammen und PONANT prüft regelmässig die fachgerechte Entsorgung.

Wiederverwendung: Wenn die Verschwendung nicht reduziert werden konnte, wird der Überschuss an Nichtregierungsorganisationen wie «FoodWise» oder «Manzer Partazer» übergeben, damit diese die Lebensmittel an benachteiligte Familien weiterverteilen können. Recycling: Ist die Essensverschwendung unvermeidlich, besteht dennoch die Möglichkeit, sie in Energie umzuwandeln. Das Hotel produziert damit Biogas oder wandelt die Abfälle in Dünger um.

Blancpain und PADI stellten ihre Partnerschaft auf dem 9. jährlichen Weltozeangipfel vor, dem Spitzenanlass der World Ocean Initiative des Economist Impact, an dem die weltweit führenden Vordenker aus Wirtschaft, Wissenschaft, Non-Profit- und staatlichen Organisationen teilnehmen, um gegen die grössten Gefahren für den blauen Planeten vorzugehen.

«Blancpain und PADI haben eine reiche Geschichte bei der Erforschung und dem Schutz der Ozeane, was uns beide bewogen hat, starke Katalysatoren für den planetarischen Wandel zu werden», sagt Drew Richardson, Präsident und CEO von PADI Worldwide. «Der Schutz unserer Ozeane ist nicht nur ein Kernpunkt unseres Ethos, sondern auch für unser eigenes Überleben entscheidend. Wenn die Welt an einem Strang zieht, um die dringende Krise in den Ozeanen einzudämmen, stehen die Chancen gut, um einen Wandel herbeizuführen. Wir sind stolz darauf, mit einem so prominenten Partner zusammenzuarbeiten, der unsere optimistischen Zukunftsaussichten und unser grosses Engagement teilt, damit die globale Gemeinschaft das Abenteuer zur Rettung der Ozeane in Angriff nimmt.»

Gemeinsam werden Blancpain und PADI mit lokalen Gemeinschaften auf der ganzen Welt zusammenarbeiten, um die Einrichtung solcher Schutzgebiete zu beschleunigen. Das Herzstück dieser mehrjährigen, millionenschweren Initiative ist das Vorzeigeprogramm Adopt the Blue, bei dem 6600 registrierte PADI-Tauchbasen und - Resorts aktiviert werden, um das grösste Netzwerk von Meeresschutzgebieten auf dem Planeten zu entwickeln, das Millionen von PADI-Sporttauchern ermöglicht, sich bei jeder Gelegenheit aktiv für den Meeresschutz einzusetzen.

Ein weiterer Eckpfeiler der Partnerschaft ist die Gründung des Programms Blancpain/PADI Community Grant, das wichtige Erhaltungsmassnahmen in lokalen Gemeinschaften finanziert. Diese Zuschüsse werden sowohl zum Schutz der Ozeane als auch zur Unterstützung der einheimischen Gemeinschaften beitragen.

«Dank der vor annähernd 70 Jahren präsentierten Taucheruhr Fifty Fathoms hat Blancpain nicht nur eine Leidenschaft, sondern auch ein tiefes Engagement für die Ozeane entwickelt», sagt Marc A. Hayek, Präsident und CEO von Blancpain. «Wir sind sehr stolz auf die Rolle, die wir bei der Förderung der weltweiten Bemühungen zum Schutz der Meere spielen konnten, und wir freuen uns, mit PADI und seinen Tauchern zusammenzuarbeiten, um noch mehr positive Veränderungen zu bewirken.»

Die erfolgreiche Einrichtung von Meeresschutzgebieten ist für die Gesundheit des grössten und wichtigsten Ökosystems der Welt von entscheidender Bedeutung. Sie trägt nachweislich dazu bei, dass die biologische Vielfalt wieder verbessert und die Resistenz gegenüber dem Klimawandel gestärkt wird, so dass sich die Populationen gefährdeter Arten wieder erholen können.

«Notwendig sind vereinte und engagierte Anstrengungen, um den Zustand der Ozeane zu verbessern. Gemeinsam lenken wir die Kraft unserer Organisationen auf eine der weltweit wichtigsten und dringendsten Aufgaben», erklärt Drew Richardson.

Taipei, June 28 (CNA) Seven local environmental groups held ocean cleanup events across northern and central Taiwan recently to raise marine conservation awareness and encourage public participation in the drafting of related laws, according to international environmental organization Greenpeace on Tuesday.

The events held on June 26 -- co-organized by Greenpeace and its partners such as Universal Volunteer, Sea Turtle Don't Cry and Hiin studio -- attracted the participation of 205 people who together collected about 1 metric ton of ocean debris, it said.

In the cleanup, which stretched from the coastline of New Taipei and Taoyuan to Miaoli County, more than half of the debris came from discarded fishing equipment like nets, buoys and cages, while there was also a significant amount of man made waste that should not have been found on a beach, said Greenpeace.

In addition, the presence of many disposable items shows the need for the reduced use of plastics, said the Sea Turtle Don't Cry group, which called on the government to accelerate related legislation to better protect Taiwan's marine ecosystems.

It is hoped that these events can help draw attention to the progress of the ""marine conservation act"" in Taiwan, Greenpeace said, adding that it launched a petition online on May 27 to speed up related efforts.

The petition, on the Public Policy Online Participation Platform, urges the Cabinet to complete its review of the draft act, which was submitted by the Ocean Affairs Council in July, 2020, by the end of this year, so it can be passed on to lawmakers.

On the platform, which allows citizens and permanent residents to make policy suggestions to the government, Greenpeace also asked the Cabinet to ensure the act highlights resource integration and plans to tackle climate change.

In addition, the act must also ensure the government's environmental surveillance data are transparent and accessible to the public, while introducing stricter law enforcement to more effectively curb and punish violations, according to the petition.

As of Tuesday afternoon the petition had collected nearly 2,000 signatures -- still under the threshold of 5,000 signatures required in 60 days, or by July 29, at which point the government is required to respond.",en,"Miaoli County, Taiwan, Taoyuan, New Taipei, Taipei","Hiin studio, Universal Volunteer, Greenpeace, CNA, Cabinet, the Public Policy Online Participation Platform, the Ocean Affairs Council",,"greenpeace, ocean, marine, environmental, taiwan, government, act, petition, cleanup, policy"

It is evening on Chumbe Island, and the smell of dinner cooking mingles with the salt breeze coming in off the water. Soon, as darkness settles, enormous terrestrial coconut crabs will come shuffling along the ancient crushed coral that makes up this little island, their claws clicking against palm trunks. But now, while the late light lingers, Ali Chagga leans toward his computer screen and smiles at me—a big white-toothed grin. “I’ve worked here as a ranger for almost 9 years,” he tells me. This place “helps me renew my brain power.”

Chagga is speaking to me from Chumbe Island Coral Park, a small marine protected area (MPA) off the coast of Tanzania and one of Marine Conservation Institute’s 21 Blue Parks. It is a crumb of craggy rock and green vegetation with one weathered white lighthouse that shines out across the shallow teal sea. Rare roseate terns skim over the surface with tail streamers like kites. Underwater, fingers of coral reach up among darting fish and slow-moving sharks. In the early 1990s Sibylle Riedmiller, a former overseas development worker, negotiated with the semi-autonomous government of Zanzibar to protect the island and surrounding coral reef as an MPA—a place where wildlife could thrive without the pressures of fishing and other destructive practices. Under Riedmiller’s leadership, the new protected area became the first managed marine park in Tanzania and the first private MPA in the world. Riedmiller’s company, Chumbe Island Coral Park Limited (CHICOP), still manages the park under a sustainable model of MPA management through revenue generated from ecotourism, and for nearly a decade Chagga has patrolled the park as an educator and ranger.",en,"Tanzania, Zanzibar","CHICOP, Marine Conservation Institute’s, Chumbe Island Coral Park Limited","Ali Chagga, Sibylle Riedmiller","island, coral, park, marine, mpa, ranger, tanzania, area, chumbe, chagga"

Cette activité qui s’inscrit dans le cadre de la célébration de la journée mondiale des océans, vise à les sensibiliser sur les bonnes pratiques de protection, d’exploitation et de conservation des océans.

En effet, la Journée Mondiale des Océans est célébrée le 8 juin de chaque année en vertu de la résolution 63/111 du 5 décembre 2008 de l’assemblée générale des Nations Unies. Les manifestations marquant cette journée sont l’occasion pour rappeler l’importance des océans, l’impact des actions humaines sur l’océan, mobiliser et unir les populations du monde sur un projet de gestion durable des océans de notre planète.

Pour cette édition 2022, le thème retenu est : « Revitalisation : action collective pour l’océan ». Ce thème s’inscrit dans le cadre de la décennie des Nations Unies pour les sciences océaniques au service du développement durable (2021-2030), et autour duquel se déroulera la Conférence sur les océans qui se tiendra à Lisbonne du 27 juin au 1er juillet prochain.

Au Togo, pour célébrer cette journée, l’ONAEM a organisé un atelier de sensibilisation à l’endroit des acteurs du secteur public que privé, de la société civile afin d’œuvrer collectivement pour la protection et l’exploitation durable des océans.

Il s’est agi de sensibiliser les acteurs à la revitalisation des bonnes pratiques d’exploitation et de conservation des océans ; encourager les acteurs du domaine maritime à une action collective pour les océans ; et de coordonner la mobilisation des acteurs et des exploitants du domaine maritime à mener des initiatives innovantes visant à assurer la protection des océans.

Le chef de cabinet du Haut Conseil pour la Mer, M. Laré Penn, a souligné que le Chef de l’Etat Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé, dans sa volonté de mutualisation des différents acteurs de l’écosystème maritime togolais, a créé l’Organisme National chargé de l’Action de l’Etat en Mer (ONAEM) afin de mieux contribuer au développement de l’économie bleue.

Depuis sa création, a-t-il fait savoir, l’ONAEM a élaboré et fait adopter des règles obligatoires, ainsi que des recommandations et des lignes directrices, afin de protéger le milieu marin contre tout impact négatif potentiel des activités de transport maritime.

A cet effet, le chef de cabinet a exhorté tous les acteurs du domaine maritime à s’approprier le thème de la journée mondiale des océans de cette année : « Revitaliser les océans par l’action collective » en participant pleinement à des activités de protection du littoral et en réfléchissant à des moyens de mieux protéger les écosystèmes marins pour la promotion de l’économie bleue et pour les générations à venir.

Le représentant du ministre de l’Environnement et des Ressources Forestières, Dr Paul Kudadze Kodjo, a indiqué que le Togo s’est engagé dans l’adaptation de son dispositif de prise en charge de toutes les questions liées à la sécurité environnementale, notamment à la lutte contre la pollution et à l’érosion côtière qui menacent les écosystèmes du littoral en élaborant avec l’appui des partenaires au développement, des outils stratégiques de développement maritime et côtier, notamment : la loi relative à la protection et à la mise en valeur du littoral ; le schéma directeur d’aménagement du littoral ; l’étude sur la mise en place d’un système d’alerte précoce météo marin ; l’observatoire national du littoral ; la restauration des écosystèmes littoraux et l’accompagnement des communautés riverains en vue de leur résilience face aux changements climatiques.

« Mesdames et Messieurs les opérateurs du secteur maritime togolais, de vos actions quotidiennes dépend soit, la préservation, soit, la dégradation de notre patrimoine commun qu’est l’océan.

Conservation status

ICUN red list, Critically Endangered.

Fisheries interactions

All life stages (eggs, juveniles, adults) may be exposed to fishing-related pressures, including:

Bottom towed gear – incidental catch (juveniles, adults) and disturbance/mortality (eggs);

Static gear – entanglement, incidental catch (juveniles, adults);

Recreational fishing – injury and/or mortality (juveniles, adults).

MPA Network

Flapper skate are protected features of the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura MPA and the Red Rocks and Longay possible MPA.

Wider seas

Population decline and contraction of range (particularly from the North and Irish seas) have been recorded for the overall common skate complex (OSPAR 2010). More recent data suggests population recovery may be occurring (Rindorf et al., 2021), although the distribution remains focused in the north and west, i.e. the west coast of Scotland, Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides.

Protection

Listed on OSPAR Annex V, the UK BAP and Scottish Biodiversity List and Priority Marine Features list. Skate in Scottish waters are covered by fisheries legislation (both domestic and retained EU law) that prohibits their landing by both commercial and recreational fishers, see:

as amended by The Common Fisheries Policy (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020.

Background – common skate complex

In 2010 a genetic study distinguished ‘common skate’ (Dipturus batis) as two species (Iglesias et al., 2010) now known as the flapper skate (D. intermedius) and the common blue skate (D. batis) (Last et al., 2016). For the sake of clarity, this document relates primarily to the flapper skate, although noting that much of the fishery-related advice is likely to be relevant to the blue skate also.

The ‘common skate’ or ‘the common skate complex’ is the wording used for flapper skate and blue skate collectively in some conservation legislation and listings.

The division of the species complex has led to difficulties in interpreting older data and information regarding the species. Prior to 2010 it is difficult to know whether flapper skate or common blue skate is being described. More recent genetic studies indicate that the vast majority of individuals in Scottish territorial waters are likely to be flapper skate D. intermedius (Griffiths et al., 2010; Bache-Jeffreys et al., 2021; Frost et al., 2020). Consequently, much of what we have learned about the species complex from research in nearshore areas is specific to flapper skate.

The common skate was once widespread across the northern North Sea, but since the 1970s has shown a marked decline and significant range contraction largely as a consequence of targeted removal by fisheries (Walker & Hislop 1998, Bache-Jeffreys et al., 2021). In common with many other elasmobranch species, the common skate is highly sensitive to exploitation due to their slow growth rates, long maturation time, long incubation period and low fecundity (Stevens et al., 2000). Recent data indicates that the skate population may have begun a recovery trajectory in the last 10 years (Rindorf et al., 2021), however its distribution remains focused in the north and west compared to the historical range.

Flapper skate ecology

Flapper skate are thought to be generalist bottom-feeders, although they also appear to be capable of active feeding in mid-water. Within the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura MPA, adults spend much of their time in deep (100 m+) trenches, however they do make use of all depths and spend time in shallower waters particularly in the winter months (Nov – April, Thorburn et al., 2021). Although the flapper skate is a mobile species capable of swimming large distances, studies point towards site fidelity being an important aspect of their ecology and life history. For example, in the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura MPA the extensive studies using mark-recapture and acoustic-tagging techniques have provided an important insight to the mixture of movement and residency. The majority of flapper skate in the MPA are resident (Neat et al., 2015, Thorburn, et al., 2021). However, some of these resident skate are known to undertake periodic trips out of the MPA (to the Clyde and Northern Ireland) and then return (J Thorburn pers comm). A smaller number of flapper skate are transient in the MPA and are simply passing through.

Flapper skate lay their eggs amongst cobbles and boulders on shallow (20-60 m) reefs (Dodd et al., in press) and the eggs take around 18 months to hatch (Benjamins et al., 2021).Until relatively recently, the understanding of flapper skate egg-laying was largely limited to records of empty egg cases found on the shore. Skate egg cases have been reported in small numbers on the west coast of Scotland, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides and in significantly greater numbers on Orkney (The Shark Trust Great Egg Hunt). More recent in situ observations of egg cases at a number of Scottish locations by divers and via remote camera surveys have provided an improved insight to this aspect of skate ecology. The data available so far points to a general habitat preference for rocky cobble / boulder substrate in depths of 25-40m. Abundances observed so far are variable. In most cases the eggs occur in low numbers, in isolated clumps whereas the Red Rocks and Longay urgent MPA was designated in March 2021 on the basis of significantly higher densities of eggs over an area of 12 km2.

The eggs take up to 18 months to hatch (Benjamins et al., 2021) but little is known about the reproductive habits of flapper skate, such as when the eggs are laid or how many eggs a female lays per year. The biology of similar skate species points to a likelihood of two eggs being laid at a time, a few days apart (Luer and Gilbert, 1985). Female skate can store sperm and consequently more than two eggs may result from a single mating event. All life stages of flapper skate (eggs, juvenile and adults) can be vulnerable to disturbance and/or capture in towed fishing gear. Domestic law and Council regulation 2020/123 - Fixing for 2021 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stock and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters (as amended) requires both commercial and recreational fishers to return flapper skate unharmed however, the ability of flapper skate and their eggs to recover from capture is unknown. Survival from discarding is thought to be relatively high for adult skate; however there is evidence of damage (ropes on tails, missing tails, scrape marks) in Skatespotter (an online photo-database of flapper skate captured during sea angling). In addition, if eggs are returned to the seabed away from favoured/optimal egg-laying habitat the eggs may not develop to hatching.

Recent data obtained by a programme of acoustic tagging in and around the Loch Sunart to Sound of Jura MPA indicated that flapper skate make use of the full range of water depths, and spent time in shallower waters especially during the winter months (November – April Thorburn et al., 2021, Lavender et al., 2021). As a result, there is no spatial separation of the skate from relevant fisheries based on depth.

A considerable understanding of the interactions with recreational fishers has been built up through angler-led tagging and recapture studies, including within the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura MPA. Multiple recaptures (often on the same day) of flapper skate studied suggests that angling does not have a significant effect on flapper skate (Neat et al., 2015). More recent studies of skate tagged with archival tags (which record temperature and depth) show that flapper skate do react to being captured by angling (by moving into deeper water and reducing their vertical activity for a period after release) (Thornburn et al., 2021). However, behavioural recovery is quick therefore they do appear to be relatively resilient to capture by anglers (Lavender et al., in prep). Anecdotal evidence from anglers shows that gravid female flapper skate occasionally release eggs on to the decks of angling vessels.

Impacts

Skate in Scottish waters are covered by fisheries legislation (both domestic and Council regulation 2020/123 - Fixing for 2021 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stock and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters (as amended) that prohibits their landing by both commercial and recreational fishers. While targeted commercial fishing for skate no longer occurs, there is the potential for a range of interactions as indicated below.

Towed demersal gear

Towed demersal gears (otter trawls and dredges) are known to take flapper skate and or other analogous large skate species as catch or bycatch (adults, juveniles and eggs) (STCEF, 2017, Fox, 2010).

Mitigation of bycatch risk is possible (e.g. the removal of tickler chains on trawls to reduce by catch, Kynoch et al., 2015). For example, this measure in combination with temporal/spatial restrictions forms part of the management measures used in the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura MPA (Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura Marine Conservation Order 2016).

Eggs and newly hatched flapper skate (around 220 mm and 280 mm long respectively, Gordon et al., 2009; Benjamins et al., 2021) are also vulnerable to bycatch in demersal towed gear due to their relatively large size.

Pelagic mobile/active gear

Gears targeting pelagic species that do not make contact with the seabed are unlikely to interact with skate (all life stages). Studies of bycatch in pelagic fisheries give no indication of skate or ray species being taken (e.g. Pierce et al., 2002). These gears are unlikely to be a high risk.

Static gears (including drift nets, gillnets, trammel nets, longlines, pots and traps)

Flapper skate (and analogous large skate species) are taken (recorded as catch or bycatch) in fisheries using gill and trammel nets, demersal drift nets and longlines (e.g. STECF, 2017). There is no evidence of interactions with eggs of flapper skate or analogous species by these gears.

There is no indication from the scientific literature to suggest that bycatch or entanglement of flapper skate in pot/creel fisheries is a concern.

There is the potential for disturbance of skate eggs / egg-laying habitat by all static gears noted here, as a result of abrasion/contact during fishing and recovery of gear. The nature of the egg-laying habitat (such as the boulder and cobble substrate found in the Red Rocks and Longay pMPA) may mitigate the effects of disturbance where the eggs are in crevices and cracks. In any event, it is likely that the potential for disturbance or abrasion caused by static fishing gears will be related to fishing intensity, however, there is no current research or evidence available to provide advice on a threshold for this risk.

Recreational angling

Flapper skate have been a popular target species for recreational anglers. However, landing is now prohibited under both domestic Scottish legislation - Scottish Statutory Instrument 2012 No.63 - The Sharks, Skates and Rays (Prohibition of Fishing, Trans-shipment and Landing) (Scotland) Order 2012 and Council regulation 2020/123 - Fixing for 2021 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stock and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters (as amended) and skate must be released promptly. Nevertheless skate are vulnerable to damage during angling and best practice guidelines on the gear used (particularly barbless hooks) and how they are handled should be followed. To reduce handling, for example, skate are no longer weighed after capture. Instead, the weight is estimated via a calculation based on length and wingspan.

NatureScot Advice

All fishing vessels and recreational anglers – the landing of flapper skate is prohibited under retained EU law and domestic Scottish legislation - Scottish Statutory Instrument 2012 No.63 - The Sharks, Skates and Rays (Prohibition of Fishing, Trans-shipment and Landing) (Scotland) Order 2012 If caught incidentally flapper skate are required to be returned to the sea unharmed and as soon as possible.

Towed gears (adult and juvenile flapper skate) – due to the potential for incidental capture and mortality, reducing or limiting towed demersal gears in areas protected for flapper skate is recommended. In addition to the general prohibition on landing flapper skate (see above) appropriate measures could include spatial measures (including seasonal or permanent exclusions) and technical measures such as the removal of tickler chains to reduce bycatch (Kynoch et al., 2015). For example, see the measures currently in place in the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura MPA.

To reduce the potential for stress on captured flapper skate, best practice in handling is important. Vessels should consider carrying large (1 m x 1 m) squares of fishing net or “lifting tarps” (1 m x 1 m of tarpaulin with carrying straps at each corner) to aid with the safe return of flapper skate. Tying ropes around the tail to return the flapper skate should be avoided wherever possible. However, if rope is used a slip knot should be tied so that the rope does not remain on the skate causing restriction of blood to the tail and eventual tail loss.

Towed gear (skate eggs and egg-laying habitat) – due to the risk of mortality of eggs and/or degradation of egg-laying habitat, the removal or avoidance of towed gears in areas protected for egg laying is a recommendation.

Static gear – nets - (adult and juvenile skate) – The removal or avoidance of demersal nets set on the seabed (drift, tangle, trammel, gill) to avoid the risk of entanglement / bycatch of flapper skate is recommended in areas protected for this species.

Static gear - pots/creels – (skate eggs and egg-laying habitat) – The risk of abrasion from fishing with pots and creels is currently unclear, but is likely to be related to the intensity of fishing. In areas identified as of importance for skate egg-laying, reducing or limiting pot/creel fishing should be considered.

Recreational angling (adult and juvenile flapper skate) – In addition to the general prohibition on landing of flapper skate (see above) best practice in angling and handling is important. The use of bronze, barbless hooks of an appropriate size is advised for flapper skate angling. Avoid lifting large flapper skate aboard angling vessels unless a gate opening close to the waterline is available. Gaffing should be avoided wherever possible. Avoid weighing skate directly, use length/width to estimate weight instead. The use of lifting tarps (as mentioned above in relation to towed gears) would also be beneficial on angling vessels.

Recreational angling (flapper skate eggs and egg laying habitat) – In areas protected for skate egg-laying, there is a risk of disturbance and stress to the breeding females during capture (including the potential loss of eggs prematurely). Therefore, the removal or avoidance of angling for flapper skate in sites protected for flapper skate eggs is recommended.

Confidence in advice

Commercial Fishing - Towed gears – High certainty. Conclusions relating to the sensitivity of skate to demersal trawls is supported by publications and grey literature reports.

Commercial Fishing – Static gears – For demersal set nets and longlines – High Certainty. For pots/creels – Medium to Low certainty due to limited evidence base for interactions with this gear type.

463,2022-02-28,Bottom trawling triples in key marine protected area despite Brexit promise,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/28/bottom-trawling-triples-in-key-marine-protected-area-despite-brexit-promise,1885,948,935,0,theguardian.com,United Kingdom,"The government is under pressure to safeguard Britain’s marine conservation areas after analysis showed the Dogger Bank protected site has seen a threefold increase in destructive bottom trawling since Brexit.

A year ago, conservationists welcomed government proposals to ban trawling and dredging fishing practices, which involve dragging weighted nets over the seabed, in 14,030 sq km (5,400 sq miles) of English waters, an area equivalent to the size of Northern Ireland. The area includes Dogger Bank and three other marine protected areas (MPAs).

The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) analysed fishing data tracked by Global Fishing Watch and found bottom trawling and dredging had increased at the site from about 1,700 hours a year between 2015 and 2018, to 5,500 hours a year between 2020 and the end of 2021.

It accused the government of “broken promises and delayed action” over the proposed fishing ban, which is not yet in place a year on. The ban was introduced via a bylaw, which is typically passed within 12 months.

In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said new bylaws to ban bottom trawling in the four MPAs were “being finalised”, but did not give a timescale.

The Dogger Bank MPA, one of the largest sandbanks in Europe, at 12,300 sq km, is a vital breeding ground for commercial species including cod and whiting, as well as sand eels, which are a food source for puffins, porpoises and kittiwakes. It is also an important site for blue carbon, the CO2 sequestered and stored in coastal and marine ecosystems.

Nearly a quarter of UK territorial waters are covered by MPAs, set up to protect vital ecosystems and species, including harbour porpoises and dolphins. This network is a symbol of the government’s target to protect 30% of ocean biodiversity by 2030.

However, more than 97% of British MPAs are being dredged and bottom trawled, according to data shared with the Guardian.

Dr Jean-Luc Solandt, principal specialist in MPAs at the MCS said: “MPAs are currently a lie. There has been an incredible increase in damaging fishing in the Dogger Bank since we left the EU. Are we really ‘taking back control’ of our waters?

“The government promised this a year ago. We were very optimistic but nothing has happened. There is no sign of the promised timetable to ensure management for England’s entire list of 40 offshore MPAs.”

At current rates, it would take more than a decade to get management in place for all MPAs, Solandt said.

Frith Dunkley, MPA researcher at MCS said: “In the year since this bylaw banning bottom-towed fishing gear from Dogger Bank MPA was proposed, the sandbank habitat and the species it was designated to protect have continued to be damaged by fishing activity, degrading marine life and removing ecologically important species such as sand eels.”

This week, the MCS is launching a social media campaign with the hashtag MarineUnprotectedAreas, calling for the public to tweet their MPs and MSPs to ban bottom trawling and dredging in offshore MPAs.

Ministers also face pressure to safeguard the seabed from within the Tory party. On Tuesday, the former transport secretary, Chris Grayling, will raise a 10-minute motion in parliament for a bill introducing a duty on the secretary of state to ban bottom trawling in MPAs.

Charles Clover, executive director of the Blue Marine Foundation, which will back the MCS campaign, said: “If we have learned anything in marine conservation it is this: meaningful protection allows for significant and swift regeneration. In order to protect our fish stocks and low-impact fisheries the UK must wake up and efficiently protect these ‘protected areas’, from the seabed up.”

The government has argued that, before Brexit, it did not have control over fishing rights.

When George Eustice, the environment secretary, announced proposals to ban bottom trawling in the four MPAs last year, he said: “Now that we have left the common fisheries policy, we are able to deliver on our commitment to achieve a healthy, thriving and sustainable marine environment.”

Citing the Fisheries Act’s power to further protect Britain’s seas, Eustice added: “This proposal to introduce bylaws to safeguard four of our precious offshore marine protected areas shows how we are putting these powers into action.”

Located about 75 miles east of Hull, the Dogger Bank has been heavily fished for decades. Bottom trawling releases carbon from the seabed into the ocean, reducing its ability to buffer climate breakdown. Dogger Bank has the capacity to store the most carbon out of all English MPAs, according to the MCS.

Last September, Greenpeace dropped giant boulders from its ship into the Dogger Bank MPA in order to create an exclusion zone for trawlers.

A Defra spokesperson said: “We are focused on ensuring all English MPAs are being effectively managed as quickly as possible – 98 in-shore MPAs now have management measures in place to protect sensitive features from bottom-towed fishing gears.

Although South West Deeps (East), 190 km southwest of Cornwall, has been designated a Marine Protected Area (MPA), fishing is still allowed because the status does not automatically prohibit it.

The seabed is trawled by weighted nets, which tear up marine habitats, for an average of 5,000 hours a year, according to the Marine Conservation Society.

The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has criticised Greenpeace's plan to plunge rocks into the 4,655 kilometre squared site, larger than Cornwall itself, in an attempt to make it ""off limits"" to bottom trawling.

The charity says celebrities including actor Simon Pegg are backing its calls to ban bottom trawling there, where giant fan mussels grow to almost half a metre in size.

""It's a no-brainer,"" said Simon Pegg. Properly protecting ocean conservation areas ""won't only help wildlife recover, it will also help our local fishermen recover their livelihoods and bolster our coastal communities,"" he said.

Conservationists want trawling banned in protected areas because it tears up delicate ecosystems such as seagrasses to catch species such as cod, squid and flatfish.

Greenpeace's ship Arctic Sunrise will set sail in the coming weeks to begin dropping boulders at South West Deeps, having previously dropped granite on to Dogger Bank in the North Sea and in the Offshore Brighton marine protected area.

UK Government agency the Marine Management Organisation took Greenpeace to court over the Dogger Bank barrier, but dropped the matter in February after a judge invited it to reconsider.

""Both the MMO and Greenpeace are committed to improving the marine environment... the parties in this case should be allies, not antagonists,"" Newcastle Crown Court Judge Edward Bindloss commented.

The MMO has this year banned bottom trawling at four of the UK's 76 protected zones, including Dogger Bank, and is working on bans at 13 further sites.

A spokesperson said they were ""surprised and disappointed"" by Greenpeace's plan to ""undertake further unlawful activity... particularly as MMO and Greenpeace have a shared interest in protecting our precious marine environment"".

They said the MMO had met with Greenpeace and invited campaigners and other environmental non-government organisations to a workshop this month to discuss ongoing MPA work.

Greenpeace's announcement coincides with the first day of the UN's Global Ocean Treaty Negotiations, which aims to agree a legal framework to protect international waters.

465,2022-07-31,The Guardian view on fishing: marine protection should mean what it says | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/the-guardian-view-on-fishing-marine-protection-should-mean-what-it-says,215,75,137,2,theguardian.com,United Kingdom,"Damage to the world’s oceans generally takes place out of sight, meaning it can be even harder to build momentum behind policymaking than it is to tackle other forms of harm to wildlife. But shocking data gathered by marine conservation NGOs, revealing that 90% of Britain’s marine protected areas (MPAs) are still being fished using the most destructive methods, should serve as a wake-up call. The UK government is officially signed up to a target of protecting 30% of our territorial waters by 2030. So far, action is lagging a long way behind words.

With a desperately needed global oceans treaty due to be negotiated in August , the UK government should live up to its pledges. If nations are unwilling to protect the marine environment in their own waters, the chance of reaching agreement over international ones could slip away. The level of protection provided by the designation of MPAs has been exposed as too minimal to be meaningful. Last year, just 10% were not fished using highly destructive dredging or bottom-trawling equipment – which Greenpeace likens to “bulldozing” the seabed.

Awareness of the importance of the oceans in regulating the climate, by storing what is known as blue carbon, as well as the urgency of managing the world’s fisheries sustainably, has risen sharply. But so has the scale of destructive industrial fishing, and the threat posed by deep-sea mining. The UK has presented itself as a model to follow on marine conservation – as it was on climate change laws. Protected zones are meant to aid species and ecosystem recovery. In some cases, the creation of off-limits nursery areas has been shown to help fishers too. A recent book by the marine biologist Fiona Gell explains how the Isle of Man government worked with the local fishing industry in developing its marine conservation plans.

The 2020 Fisheries Act gave UK ministers powers to ban bottom-trawling in protected areas. But so far bans have been introduced in only four – a minuscule proportion of the total. The creation of five highly protected areas – effectively no-take zones where all fishing is banned – was recently mooted for sites including one off the coast of Lindisfarne in Northumberland and another in the Channel. Separately, Scotland is now committed to fully or highly protected areas across 10% of its waters. But the regulation of the existing protected areas must also be toughened up.

Already, the EU has stolen a march on the UK with a vote in its parliament to ban a technique known as “fly shooting”, which uses lead-weighted ropes to capture entire shoals of fish, from French waters in the Channel – a vote that must now be considered by the European Commission and member states. Notably, this was at the instigation of small-scale fishers who struggle to compete with industrial factory ships. Enforcement is essential, as well as regulation. Rules are no use if there is no means of stopping them from being broken. NGOs continue to do essential work in exposing what is going on. Governments urgently need to catch up. An end to dredging licences in the UK’s existing protected areas is not a big ask.",en,"Lindisfarne, Isle of Man, Northumberland, Scotland, UK, Britain","EU, Greenpeace, Guardian, the European Commission",Fiona Gell,"marine, areas, uk, fishing, waters, oceans, conservation, destructive, government, protection"

The Scottish Government's vision is for a marine environment that is clean, healthy, safe, productive and diverse seas; managed to meet the long term needs of nature and people.

Scotland’s Marine Protected Area (MPA) network is being developed to help safeguard our most important natural and cultural heritage features on the principle of sustainable use. By doing so we are protecting the natural goods and services they provide for current and future generations to enjoy.

Flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius) are a critically endangered species. They were historically abundant in the North-east Atlantic and widely distributed in the seas surrounding the British Isles, however its range has reduced significantly and catch rates declined throughout the 20th century. The flapper skate now only occurs in the northern North Sea, off Northern Ireland’s north-east coast and off Scotland’s north-west coast.

Now considered its own species, it was once thought that flapper skate and blue skate were the same species, called common skate. Flapper skate and blue skate (Dipturus batis) are now known as part of the common skate complex.

Little is known about flapper skate breeding grounds and breeding habits due to their rarity. Their eggs take around 18 months to hatch and are sensitive to disturbance from a number of marine activities during that time.

The purpose of this consultation is to seek your views on the designation of Red Rocks and Longay as a nature conservation Marine Protected Area as well as the associated Marine Conservation Order.

Under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, Scottish Ministers can designate a Marine Protected Area (MPA) on an urgent basis without publishing notice of their proposals or consulting those likely to be affected.

Red Rocks and Longay was designated as an MPA in this way in March 2021, following confirmation of the discovery of flapper skate nursery grounds. An urgent Marine Conservation Order (MCO) was put in place at the same time to manage fisheries activity. The boundary of the MPA was extended, and an associated urgent MCO was put in place, in December 2021 because a significant number of flapper skate eggs were discovered north of the original site.

The urgently designated and urgent MCO are still in place at Red Rocks and Longay. Scottish Ministers intend to designate the Red Rocks and Longay MPA as an MPA on a permanent basis and make an associated MCO and are therefore extending the urgent MCO by making an Urgent Continuation Order following the launch of this consultation.

The Urgent Continuation Order will extend the Urgent MCO until 10 March 2023. The consultation is proposing to remove the prohibition on diving from the list of prohibited activities in the draft MCO, to allow scallop diving and observational recreational diving. This activity will be removed from the urgent MCO as soon as is reasonably practicable, in order for the prohibitions not to remain in place for any longer than is necessary. A permit will still be required for scientific diving or surveys which would involve (for example) taking, touching or disturbance of flapper skate eggs.

Full proposals can be found in the consultation paper linked below.

Virtual information sessions are being held on 24th and 29th March during the consultation. Each drop-in session will last for 15-20 minutes where information can be provided on the current consultation, how to access information and respond. This is an opportunity to ask questions and get general information on the site and features to be protected, however consultation response should still be submitted through the page you are on at the moment. Further details and places can be booked through Eventbrite.

Their names were stencilled onto the boulders before being dropped into the ocean.

From today’s Western Morning News

Greenpeace UK has placed 18 limestone boulders on the seabed in the South West Deeps (East) Marine Protected Area to block what it claims is “destructive industrial fishing.”

On Thursday, campaigners and crew on board Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise sailed to the western English Channel to make a portion of the South West Deeps off-limits to bottom-trawling.

But the move has been criticised by the fishing industry and the Marine Management Organisation, (MMO) who say they are already accelerating plans to extend protection for the UK’s Marine Protected Areas.

And, they warn, dumping boulders into the sea in this way potentially puts fishermen’s lives at risk.

The Fishing Daily reports that after an earlier boulder drop at Dogger Bank, the MMO took Greenpeace to court for environmental breaches, but the case was dropped in February this year after a judge at Newcastle Crown Court invited the MMO to reconsider, saying prosecution was not in the public interest.

The MMO told the fishing publication that Greenpeace was aware it was delivering accelerated protection measures within Marine Protected Areas. “As such, we are surprised and disappointed by the announcement made by Greenpeace of their intention to undertake further unlawful activity within this specific MPA at South West Deeps (East),” the MMO said.

Greenpeace say the latest boulder action off the South West coast took place days after UK leaders failed to help secure a Global Ocean Treaty at IGC5 in New York. That failure threatens the Government’s aim to achieve at least 30% ocean protection by 2030 the environmental organisation claims.

Greenpeace alleges: “Across the entirety of the South West Deeps (East) – more than 4,600 km2 – there is not one metre of protection from destructive industrial fishing. It is one of the most heavily fished so-called Marine Protected Areas in the UK. In the last 18 months, the South West Deeps experienced almost 19,000 hours of industrial fishing, 3,370 hours of which was bottom-trawling. The majority of industrial fishing vessels in the area were from France (53%) followed by Spain (30%) and Great Britain (9%).

Celebrities Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall, Simon Pegg, Stephen Fry, and Daniel Lismore are supporting the action, alongside Conservative politicians Henry Smith MP, Sir Peter Bottomley MP and Theresa May’s former Downing Street environment advisor Lord Randall, as well as the Green Party’s Caroline Lucas MP. Their names were stencilled onto the boulders before being dropped into the ocean.

The 18 boulders are Portland limestone, and each weighs between 500kg and 1,400kg. They make it impossible for bottom-towed fishing gear to be dragged along the seabed.One boulder has giant ammonite sculpture carved into it.",en,"Great Britain, France, UK, Spain, New York, Portland","Greenpeace UK, Greenpeace, Downing Street, the Marine Management Organisation, The Fishing Daily, Newcastle Crown Court, the Green Party’s, MMO, Western Morning News","Caroline Lucas, Henry Smith, Stephen Fry, Simon Pegg, Peter Bottomley, Theresa May’s, Daniel Lismore, Hugh Whittingstall","greenpeace, fishing, boulders, mp, south, west, marine, deeps, mmo, action"

In it, they make the following key recommendations to the UK Government for tackling the climate crisis through ocean protections (alongside real term emissions cuts through ending the use of fossil fuels):

Ensure that the Marine Protected Area (MPA) network protects blue carbon stored in the seabed through restrictions on damaging activities, including commercial fishing.

Deliver Highly Protected Marine Areas (HPMAs) which protect blue carbon ecosystems.

Include blue carbon protections in fisheries policy, including the Joint Fisheries Statement.

Ensure that blue carbon is protected through marine spatial planning, including the marine spatial prioritisation programme.

Increase funding and support for projects which build the climate resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems through their protection and restoration.

Use the Local Nature Recovery (LNR) scheme, Nature for Climate Fund and flooding funding to finance blue carbon protection and restoration.

Deliver Marine Net Gain to support restoration of blue carbon ecosystems at sea.

Properly account for blue carbon stores in carbon accounting through the inclusion in the first instance of seagrass and saltmarshes in the greenhouse gas inventory and include ambitious blue carbon habitat protection and restoration targets in the UK Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

Support international agreements to protect blue carbon around the world.

Ensure that the ‘blue belt’ programme in the UK Overseas Territories (UKOTs) includes protections of blue carbon.

Reform the UK Marine Strategy, and integrate blue carbon considerations into other policies, including revised land use policies, to better protect blue carbon habitats.

Support a science-led strategy through the UK Blue Carbon Forum and invest in better monitoring of blue carbon habitats.

These measures will protect these vital ecosystems which have been found to sequester and store around 2% of UK emissions per year, though this is likely an underestimate (2% is equivalent to emissions from the industrial processes sector which includes activities such as cement production). Effective policies can ensure that this figure rises to sequester a greater proportion of UK emissions.

The recommendations centre around the United Nation’s ’30 by 30’ goal, which aims to protect and effectively manage 30% of the planet’s marine and 30% of the planet’s terrestrial environment by 2030. The Biodiversity Deep Dive set out following high-level recommendations, including:

Transform the protected sites portfolio so that it is better, bigger, and more effectively connected so that plants and wildlife are able to travel and adapt to climate change

Increase the footprint of the Marine Protected Areas network

Unlock the potential of designated landscapes (National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty) so they deliver more for nature

Recommendations for the marine environment

Specifically in relation to the marine environment, the authors recommended the following:

Completing the Marine Protected Area network to ensure the shortfalls in the protection of habitats and species of conservation interest are addressed, species and habitats are well-represented and the network is connected and ecologically coherent.

Finalising the structured evaluation of potential fishing gear interactions with features of Marine Protected Areas and consult on the necessary management measures needed.

Establish a targeted scheme to support restoration of seagrass and saltmarsh habitats along our coastline

Create opportunities for marine and freshwater fishers to support natures recovery, and where appropriate undertaking management actions for biodiversity and habitat enhancement.

Response from the Minister for Climate Change

In response to the report, Julie James, the Minister for Climate Change put out a written statement which committed the Welsh Government to the following for the marine environment:

We will accelerate action to complete the MPA network, to ensure the shortfalls in protection of habitats and features are addressed. This will mean the MPA network is ecologically coherent and connected, improving resilience and condition.

We will finalise the assessment of potential fishing gear interactions with features of Marine Protected Areas. This will enable us to understand what damage these do to MPA features and what management measures may be needed to prevent this.

The UK will help to protect some of the world’s most important and biodiverse marine environments in the Eastern Pacific, including key migratory routes for sea turtles, whales, sharks, and rays.

At COP26 in Glasgow, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama made headlines with their announcement that the four countries are now working together to expand and connect marine protection covering over 500,000 km2 of ocean.

The Eastern Tropical Marine Corridor stretches from the rich breeding and feeding grounds around Malpelo Island, the Cocos Ridge, and the Cordillera de Coiba seamounts, to the Galapagos Islands that inspired Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution.

The UK will invest an initial £2m of UK Aid though the World Bank’s PROBLUE fund, and deploy marine experts to provide technical assistance through our Ocean Country Partnership Programme.

This initiative is supported by the UK’s newly established Blue Planet Fund. Speaking at a meeting of the Forum of Ministers of Environment of Latin America and the Caribbean in Costa Rica, Lord Goldsmith said:

“I commend and thank Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama for their leadership. This is exactly the sort of ambition and cooperation we need now.

I am delighted that the UK will be supporting this inspiring initiative through our newly established Blue Planet Fund, drawing on decades of experience protecting an area of ocean larger than India around the UK Overseas Territories.

The Eastern Tropical Marine Corridor is set to become the largest transboundary marine protected area in the world, taking us closer to protecting at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030 – a UK-led campaign backed by over 100 countries.”

The Lundy Marine Festival is being organised and run by Robert Irving, a marine biological consultant who has been involved with Lundy and the management of its MPA for 40 years. The press release for the festival is below:

‘There is lots being planned for everyone to get involved in. During the Festival there will be activities such as a marine bioblitz (recording all of the marine species found on the shores and in the subtidal), coastal walks, themed and interactive games, rockpool rambles and, for the really intrepid, snorkel safaris. There’ll also be citizen science projects such as using the iNaturalist app on your mobile phone to record photos of marine species you encounter so experts can identify them; or, if you’re a diver, inspecting the health of pink sea fans, a nationally protected species.

The Darwin Tree of Life project, overseen by staff from the Natural History Museum and the Marine Biological Association, will be on the island for the first few days of the Festival, when the island’s Church will be doubling up as a ‘pop-up’ marine laboratory.

Thanks to sponsorship from the Blue Marine Foundation, we are also making a short film about the effectiveness of the MPA’s No Take Zone off the island’s east coast, something of particular relevance given the government’s recent announcement of establishing five trial Highly Protected Marine Areas elsewhere around the English coast.

Within the MPA lie three shipwrecks of historic importance, two of which (the Iona II, a paddle steamer which sank in 1864; and a battleship HMS Montagu, which ran into the island in 1906) will be featured in special Protected Wreck Days being organised by the Nautical Archaeology Society and funded by Historic England. A recent photogrammetry survey of the Iona II will allow the wreck to be viewed in 3-D when using Virtual Reality headsets.

The Marine Protected Area at Lundy has been a leading light in the field of marine conservation in the UK. It was the country’s first statutory Marine Nature Reserve (1986), the first to have a Zoning Scheme (1993), the first to have a No Take Zone (2003) and the first to become a Marine Conservation Zone (2010). It has led the way in marine environmental protection and management in the UK through solid science and effective conservation work. We look forward to welcoming you to the island to learn more about its marine life, its shipwrecks and the management of its waters.’

Negotiations for a new UN Treaty to protect two thirds of the planet have ended without conclusion at the UN Headquarters in New York, meaning that a further meeting will be required.

The final scheduled negotiation was hoped to conclude a multi-year process to bring protection to marine biodiversity through a new, High Seas Treaty. Many States, including the 48 members of the High Ambition Coalition, have committed to the goal of concluding negotiations in 2022, and will now need to accelerate work in the coming months and extend the negotiations via an additional meeting this year, if they are to deliver on their pledges and the protection needed to bring the ocean back from the brink.

Peggy Kalas, Director of the HSA said:

“Many governments entered the negotiations with a renewed sense of urgency after a two-year pause due to COVID but we have not reached the Treaty goal yet. All efforts must be devoted in the coming months to secure this long-awaited treaty in 2022; a goal expressed by many governments that committed to the High Ambition Coalition.”

Will McCallum, Head of Oceans for Greenpeace UK said:

“Our oceans are in crisis and getting this treaty right is critical. Governments are being judged on the ambitious pledges they have made, and right now they’re falling short: the pace of these discussions is glacial and the lack of agreement on a number of key issues shows that at the end of two weeks of negotiations we are simply not on track for the ultimate goal of protecting at least a third of our global oceans by 2030. Ministers and heads of state need to step up ahead of the next round of negotiations to ensure we land the strong treaty we need in 2022. Anything less is a failure.”

“As the BBNJ-negotiations draw to a close, environmental multilateralism is at a critical junction for our planet. Decision-makers now have a clear opportunity to make meaningful and bold progress in the intersessional towards curbing transboundary pollution and to protect our ocean, an important pillar in fending off the devastating impacts of climate change. We hope governments will rise to the occasion, ensure that the High Seas Treaty is accomplished in the second half of 2022 and not let our planet down. ”said Fabienne McLellan, Managing Director at OceanCare.

“Time does not stand still and the urgency to protect our offshore treasures continues. In Latin America we have seen ambition from States like Costa Rica and Chile, we hope others raise their ambition”. Gladys Martínez, Executive Director of AIDA

“It’s a relief that after a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic, the fourth round of negotiations for a long overdue UN Treaty to protect high seas life resumed this month and country delegates were able to meet in person and roll up their sleeves to continue their work. However, progress has been slow with delegates inching closer to agreement on several critical issues. With the recent creation of a High Ambition Coalition, we’d hoped for much more progress in New York. Governments will really need to step up the pace and political will to get a strong treaty over the finish line this year.” Richard Page, Campaigns Director, RISE UP

The negotiations, which began in 2018 after a decade of discussions, can only be concluded through an additional meeting, not previously mandated by the UN General Assembly. The High Seas Alliance is adamant that this must be held in 2022, if States are to meet their own commitment to finalise a High Seas Treaty this year and achieve 30% protection of the ocean by 2030. Marine protected areas, including highly and fully protected areas in the High Seas are not possible without the new Treaty in place.

The enthusiasm to achieve a robust Treaty was evident among many of the negotiators with higher levels of engagement and flexibility than has been the case to date.

479,2022-05-19,MARINE PROTECTION FOR GULF IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA,https://fishfocus.co.uk/marine-protection-for-gulf-in-western-australia/,48,45,3,0,fishfocus.co.uk,United Kingdom,"The Western Australia Minister for Environment, Reece Whitby, has announced an Exmouth Gulf Taskforce would be established and funded as one of the McGowan Government’s responses to the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) report on Exmouth Gulf, delivered in 2021. The EPA report confirmed the Gulf is of global importance, fragile, under pressure and needs conservation attention, and new protected areas (including where major industrial development has been proposed) as a high priority.

Paul Gamblin, Director of Protect Ningaloo, said, “We welcome this announcement by Minister Whitby, and the strong signal it sends that the future of Exmouth Gulf and its economy must be based on protecting the environment rather than threatening it with industrial development. The establishment of the Exmouth Gulf Taskforce is an implicit acknowledgment by Government that the area needs much greater conservation attention, consistent with the EPA’s advice.

“The Exmouth Gulf Taskforce must take full advantage of this important opportunity to provide a clear conservation direction and long-awaited certainty for the Gulf, which has been buffeted by one major industrial proposal after another in recent years, causing a great deal of concern across the broad community in Exmouth and WA. It’s time to clear the decks forever of industrial threats like the controversial port and a massive salt operation, and instead, support investment in low impact economic activity like ecotourism, cultural tourism, marine science and education.

“In parallel with the new Taskforce, the McGowan Government’s top priority for Exmouth Gulf must be to follow through quickly on its commitment in December 2021 to protect high priority places like the Qualing Pool precinct and the Eastern Gulf, both at risk from industrial development. A boost in funding from last week’s budget must see this crucial, overdue work accelerated.

“These are important first steps, however, we also need to see the Government follow up with the protection of other globally significant values of Exmouth Gulf, including the Wetland of National Importance on the eastern side of the Gulf,” said Mr Gamblin.

Minister Whitby and the Minister for Fisheries, Don Punch, also confirmed funding for the creation of a marine park in Exmouth Gulf over the next two years.

“We’re pleased to see the Government allocate new funding for this process which includes essential support for Traditional Owners to fully engage in the joint planning and management of the new marine park.”

“We know there is strong support in the community for marine parks and we must ensure the areas that should be protected in the Gulf are informed by the best available science and the knowledge of people who understand the area and its incredible wildlife and habitats,” said Mr Gamblin.

Lundy Island, which lies just off the North Devon coast, is home to an incredible array of wildlife, from its famous puffins (Lundy is Norse for Puffin Island!) to its inquisitive Atlantic Grey Seals.

The waters around Lundy Island are subject to various oceanic currents, creating an awe-inspiring and unique underwater ecosystem, home to some surprising and rare species. Many of the plants and animals around Lundy are fragile, and have really benefitted from the heavy protection offered to the water around the Island. Lundy’s amazing marine world has become famous for its corals, lobsters, seabirds and the seals which mate and give birth around the island each year.

The film is 8 minutes 46 seconds long, and can be viewed on YouTube via the link below. We encourage the showing of the film to Primary and Secondary schools, and it hits several key elements of the KS1-4 Science and Geography curricula. If you do show the film to your class, please let us know what you think! We hope you enjoy watching it as much as we enjoyed researching and producing it. And if you need any help screening it, please get in touch.

This summer (2022) we’re running our first Vitamin Sea Project trips to Lundy Island, taking two groups of young people snorkelling within the Marine Protected Area, to see for themselves the amazing life underwater around our coast. We’re so looking forward to it.

If you’d like any more information about the film or our work, please get in touch via the link below.

The film was very kindly supported by our friend Felix Appelbe at Ocean Ambassadors, and dryrobe whose offices are just across the water from Lundy in Braunton, North Devon.

The film was researched, presented and produced by Cal Major, filmed and edited by James Appleton, with additional footage very kindly donated by Mark Lavington and Mike Deaton. Huge thanks to Lundy Island’s Wardens past and present, in particular Dean Jones who you’ll see in the film.

IUCN are delighted to open a call for proposals to host the 6th International Marine Protected Area Congress (IMPAC 6) in 2026. Since 2005 a global community of marine protected area managers and practitioners have come together once every four years at IMPAC, co-chaired by IUCN and the World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA).

IMPAC aims to share knowledge and experience and to join efforts to strengthen best practices in the creation and management of MPAs. Through these exchanges, it aims to promote the effective conservation of marine biodiversity as well as the natural and cultural heritage of the oceans. Canada has the pleasure of hosting IMPAC5 in Vancouver in 2023.

The four first IMPAC meetings were a tremendous success with high attendance rates, taking place in Geelong, Australia (2005), Washington, D.C., United States of America (2009), Marseille, France (2013), and La Serena, Chile (2017).

Over time, momentum has gathered force in numbers of individual and organisational participants and also state representatives, making IMPAC the technical and political platform to position MPAs as a key instrument for ocean regeneration, at the same time preserving the rights of indigenous people and empowering local communities of any MPA.

IUCN hope that you are positioned for a proposal to host the 6th IMPAC in 2026. Ideally the proposal will be between 10 to 12 pages long with contents summarised in an Annex (example Annex below). No doubt this correspondence will raise questions and excitement, and they look forward to further discussing IMPAC6 with you.

If you wish to be considered as a host country for IMPAC6, please submit your proposal by October 3, 2022, to Ocean@iucn.org (copy to fparedesv@gmail.com).

The host country and city will be chosen by the Selection Committee in late November 2022. If you are selected as the host country, we look forward to you attending IMPAC5 in Vancouver for the announcement of your winning selection and hand-over ceremony.

The selection committee will give special consideration to proposals coming from regions that have not previously hosted an IMPAC congress, have partnered with other countries for support, and have clear diversity and inclusion principles.

The Selection Committee is an international group comprised of WCPA-Marine (co-chair) and IUCN Ocean Team representatives, and previous hosts of IMPAC meetings.

IUCN look forward to receiving your proposal to host IMPAC6.

Please submit your EOI using these forms and guidelines:

488,2022-01-17,Green charities deliver verdict on stalled “super year” for marine protection,https://www.wcl.org.uk/green-charities-deliver-verdict-on-stalled-marine-super-year.asp,12,0,12,0,wcl.org.uk,United Kingdom,"17 January 2022

The Government declared 2021 would be a Marine Super Year, highlighting ‘unprecedented alignment of international and domestic marine agendas’ at the Coastal Futures Conference 2021. [1]



One year on, ahead of the 2022 major annual conference on marine conservation, UK charities including the Marine Conservation Society, RSPB, and The Wildlife Trusts, have issued a new scorecard report which shows the Government has made no demonstrable progress in 11 out of 17 important steps for action on ocean recovery. [2]



This follows huge criticism in 2020 when the Government missed its goal (set under EU law) of achieving Good Environmental Status for the UK’s seas. The Government failed to meet 11 out of 15 targets for healthy seas, which the charities say is a mark of a deep ecological crisis at sea. For example, the target for Good Status for waterbirds was missed, with sharp declines for some marine bird species like the Kittiwake in both the Celtic Seas and the Greater North Sea. There has also been public outcry over the impacts of sewage discharges into the sea, with sewage spilling into coastal bathing waters 5,517 times in the last year.



Sean Clement of WWF-UK, Chair of the Wildlife and Countryside Link Marine Group, which coordinated the report, said: “While there have been highlights in 2021 such as the commitment to tackle bottom trawling and deliver new Highly Protected Marine Areas, overall we’re disappointed in this stalled super year. The urgency of the climate and nature emergencies means policies to protect and restore our amazing marine life cannot be kicked into the long seagrass, 2022 must be the moment that words turn into action”.



The report ‘2021: The Marine Super Year? An assessment of Government progress on ocean protection’, analysed progress for five key areas for action. The five key areas include setting ocean recovery targets; policy to protect and enhance marine wildlife; offshore planning for renewables and nature; reducing bycatch of marine wildlife by fishing boats; and locking away “blue carbon” to reduce climate change. It found that in every area Government action had been insufficient to help halt the decline of nature.



The report highlights that there has been an increasing public and political awareness of the vital role that healthy seas play in building healthy communities and in fighting the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. However, it said that those opportunities could be missed, with policy on sustainable fishing particularly lacking ambition.



The Government has not committed to ensure that fishing catch limits are set within scientifically recommended sustainable levels. It has also taken no action to roll-out Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) to ensure that boats stick to rules like quota allocations and sustainability requirements. This is critical to reduce the thousands of avoidable fishing-related deaths of dolphins, whales, porpoises, sea-birds and other marine-life. A promise in February from the Secretary of State that bottom trawling would be prohibited in the Dogger Bank special conservation area, alongside three other English MPAs, has also yet to be put into action.



Dr Richard Benwell, Chief Executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “Government is like a super tanker. It is slowly changing course, but it is still carrying a payload of environmental destruction along the way. Our marine environment can’t afford to wait.



“Ministers have made some excellent commitments for ocean recovery, but action has been slow to follow. We hope that 2021 was a ‘behind the scenes super year’ and that real change to halt destructive bottom trawling, tackle bycatch of dolphins and seals, and genuine protection for marine habitats will soon surface in 2022.”



One area where there has been positive progress is the Government’s flagship Highly Protected Marine Areas (HPMA) programme, which have the potential to restrict fishing and other damaging activities from selected marine sites in English waters, with new HPMA’s to be piloted. [3] In particular, the report highlights the role that HPMAs can play in protecting biodiversity and reducing climate change by protecting “blue carbon” habitats, such as the seabed and seagrasses, which capture and lock away greenhouse gases. The Government elevated the role of the ocean in the climate negotiations last year at COP26 and the Environment Agency has mapped the areas of our coast and seabed that can best support our net-zero goals.



Joan Edwards OBE, Director Policy and Public Affairs at The Wildlife Trusts said: “While 2021 has laid the groundwork, we hope to see the delivery of vital HPMAs in 2022, with a list of pilot sites this Spring and for these protections to be in place by the year’s end. Action to protect our precious marine life remains in the Government’s reach and the ambitions for a Marine Super Year can still be achieved given sufficient political will.



“We call on the Government to enact the policies we have highlighted as outstanding from 2021 as the basis of a comprehensive marine recovery agenda for 2022.”



Ocean and conservation experts are calling for three key actions from Government to make 2022 a new super-year for ocean action:



1. Measures to ensure our Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are genuinely protected, including:



- The effective prohibition of all harmful activities such as bottom-trawling in MPAs



- Effective identification and safeguarding of priority Blue Carbon resources



2. Implementation of robust monitoring and enforcement across the UK fishing fleet, and particularly the use of Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) cameras and associated mitigation measures, are vital to dramatically reduce the unacceptably high number of fishing-related deaths for dolphins, porpoises, sharks, seabirds and other marine-life. It would be welcome if REM was incentivised in the Government’s new £65m fishing infrastructure scheme.



3. The refocusing of the UK Marine strategy to provide a clear route-map to achieving 2030 targets, to protect 30% of UK waters for nature and to halt nature’s decline in UK seas

To celebrate the five-year anniversary of its launch in 2016, the Blue Action Fund (hereafter “Blue Action”) is releasing a new Impact Report to share the inspirational achievements of the projects it supports to protect the ocean and build resilient coastal communities.

The ocean provides food and livelihoods for billions of people and could deliver over 20% of the emissions reductions needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C – but action to build the sustainable ocean we desperately need currently receives less than 1% of global official development assistance. Blue Action is providing a cutting-edge solution for filling this massive gap in ocean protection funding.

Less than five years since the start of its unique Grant Programme, Blue Action is today one of the world’s largest public funders promoting marine conservation and sustainable coastal livelihoods. And, through the exceptional impact made by the projects it helps fund, Blue Action is already on track to establish or strengthen over 350,000 km2 of marine protected areas (MPAs) and directly benefit more than 225,000 people around the shores of Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Pacific.

These projects are working on the frontline of the global nature and climate crisis to combat the devastating decline in ocean biodiversity, bolster defences against climate change, and create sustainable opportunities for local people. From Mozambique to the Galapagos, South Africa to the Solomon Islands, projects supported by the Blue Action Grant Programme are providing a lifeline to a healthy ocean and making a real difference to people who depend on the sea for survival.

Blue Action’s Executive Director, Markus Knigge reports that:

“our grantees are driving change both out in the water and in the heart of their communities by expanding effective marine protection and strengthening local livelihoods. Their projects are living proof that ‘blue action’ can unleash multiple benefits by boosting food security, job creation, climate resilience, and community stability in some of the world’s most vulnerable coastal regions.”

Initiated by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and KfW Development Bank, Blue Action is also supported by the governments of Sweden, France and Norway, and has received funding from the Green Climate Fund. That creates an efficient, one-stop platform where NGOs can access funds to support their work and encourages greater investment in practical ocean conservation where it matters most.

As Heike Vesper, Head of Ocean Protection at WWF Germany, says:

“It’s vital that wealthy governments walk the talk and increase their financial support or we will not achieve internationally agreed targets to protect our ocean. The rapid growth of the Blue Action Fund shows how public funding can be a game-changer for life in the ocean and people on the ground.”

Blue Action invests in local projects but it is a key part of the global ocean movement that is creating a wave of change across our blue planet. World governments are on the brink of agreeing a critical new global target to protect 30% of the planet’s land and waters by 2030 – expected to be announced at the COP15 Biodiversity Summit in Kunming, China, in April this year. Meeting this goal is an essential – and enormous – challenge. Today MPAs only cover about 8% of the ocean, and less than 3% is fully protected. Projects supported by Blue Action are not only contributing directly to the ’30 by 30′ target but create a blueprint for funding effective local ocean protection action that can be replicated around the world.

“Protecting marine biodiversity and building a sustainable ocean economy are global priorities. We are delighted by the positive impacts made by the projects supported by Blue Action in its first five years and look forward to working together to strengthen ocean protection and coastal livelihoods even further in the future.” said Markus Knigge.

As well as the ’30 by 30′ target, Blue Action will also help address the ten challenges for collective impact set by the UN Decade for Ocean Science that was launched in 2021 – including to protect and restore biodiversity and to unlock ocean-based solutions to climate change.

Collective impact through local engagement is key to the success of all the projects highlighted in the Blue Action Impact Report. They show how, by working closely with artisanal fishers, women’s cooperatives, grassroots conservationists, and local authorities, it is possible to combat dramatic losses in marine biodiversity while improving the lives of local people – and helping to meet global ocean targets.

ABOUT THE BLUE ACTION FUND

Blue Action Fund recognises the ocean’s fundamental role in ensuring the health of our planet and the wellbeing of mankind. Our vision is of a carefully managed and sustainably used ocean full of abundant, healthy marine life providing major benefits to people and the environment. Our mission is to enhance the management and use of coastal and marine ecosystems to conserve marine biodiversity for future generations while improving the lives of local people today. We pursue that mission by making targeted grants to non-governmental organisations active in developing countries.

Blue Action Fund was founded in 2016 as a non-profit foundation by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in conjunction with KfW Development Bank. Subsequently, the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agence Française de Développement (AFD), and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) became funding partners and Blue Action Fund is now one of the world’s largest public funders promoting marine conservation and sustainable livelihoods in coastal communities.

The Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition welcomed the announcements from President Macron at the One Ocean Summit that will help safeguard further Antarctica’s waters. These include France publishing at the end of the month its first national polar strategy as well as the creation of the second largest marine protected area in the world around France’s Southern and Antarctic lands.

Macron also committed to continue work on the designation of the East Antarctic and Weddell Sea Marine Protected Areas in the international waters of the Southern Ocean and to work directly with President Xi of China and President Putin of Russia on the necessity to advance the agenda of biodiversity and climate protection in the region.

Pascal Lamy and Genevieve Pons, co-chairs of Antarctica2020:

“It has been very encouraging to hear many times during the Summit the importance of creating marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean. While there is still no breakthrough in unlocking opposition, this Summit has given renewed conviction to leaders such as President Macron and President Von der Leyen to engage personally with Russia and China “to work to overcome differences” and ensure historic Antarctic Ocean protection this year.”

Marine protected areas are a key tool to build resilience to the vast changes happening in the region and to help protect species and habitats. Three large marine-protected areas proposals are up for agreement at CCAMLR- the international organisation tasked with conserving Antarctic marine life.

Claire Christian, Executive Director, Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition:

“This Summit highlighted that 2022 needs to be a year of action. That includes protecting the world’s largest remaining ocean wilderness from the threats of fishing and the climate crisis. Just recently scientists highlighted the catastrophic consequences of melting glaciers for Antarctic wildlife, such as penguins, whales and seals. We need all CCAMLR countries to work together at the highest level to ensure the designation of marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean happens this year”.",en,"China, Russia, France","CCAMLR, CCAMLR-, The Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition","Claire Christian, Von Der leyen, Genevieve Pons, Pascal Lamy","ocean, southern, antarctic, marine, summit, president, areas, protection, level, macron"
492,2022-02-16,EU PROPOSES AMBITIOUS INITIATIVES FOR OCEAN PROTECTION,https://fishfocus.co.uk/eu-proposes-ambitious-initiatives-for-ocean-protection/,3,0,3,0,fishfocus.co.uk,United Kingdom,"EU proposes ambitious initiatives for ocean protection. The European Commission has presented ambitious initiatives to promote a cleaner, healthier and safer ocean, as part of the EU’s contribution to the One Ocean Summit hosted by France in Brest and a demonstration of EU’s leading role in bringing a comprehensive response to oceans challenges.

Speaking at the Summit, President von der Leyen announced three key initiatives for cooperation to preserve and revive the oceans: a new international coalition to protect biodiversity on high seas, which constitute 95% of the ocean; a major computing project allowing researchers to digitally simulate the world’s oceans; and the EU’s research mission to restore our ocean and waters by 2030. This is in addition to the full EU contribution presented throughout the Summit by Commissioners Gabriel, Vălean and Sinkevičius and addressing all four strands of the Summit.

Speaking at the One Ocean Summit, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said:

“Our mission to protect the ocean needs to be as big as our shared responsibility. That is why we have come to Brest today to join forces and turn the tide. Europe can make a huge contribution, as a maritime power. But only together can we step up protection and let our oceans teem with life again.”

At the Summit, President von der Leyen launched the high-ambition coalition on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ). The initiative underlines the EU’s role as the leading actor on global marine conservation. Areas beyond national jurisdiction represent 95% of the ocean and their biodiversity provides invaluable ecological and socio-economic benefits to humanity. However, these vast areas are increasingly vulnerable to threats, including pollution, overexploitation, and the impacts of climate change. Ongoing United Nations negotiations provide a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and the EU is working hard to reach an agreement in 2022. The Coalition brings together those who, like the EU and its Member States, strive for an ambitious UN Treaty on BBNJ conservation.

The EU’s long-standing zero-tolerance towards illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is another cornerstone of the EU’s ambitious policy for sustainable management of marine resources. IUU is a grave threat to the world’s fish stocks, pushing some to the brink of collapse. Since 2010, the EU has therefore implemented a set of measures to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU. Under these rules, the EU works with countries worldwide to promote the fight against IUU and blocks such products from entering the EU market. The EU also relies on the support of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to ensure the compliance of its own fleet through laws applicable to the Member States’ control authorities. The EU is not only leading by example, but also provides financial support through regional programmes that promote sustainable fisheries.

Pollution, in particular from plastics, is also a major threat to the ocean’s health, at both global and European level and the EU is acting towards a vision of a clean ocean. In addressing plastic pollution, the EU has two main priorities: decreasing plastic pollution and accelerating the transition to a circular economy. The Single Use Plastics (SUP) Directive, in force since 2021, sets rules for the phasing out of many frequently wasted plastic items and the collection of lost at sea fishing gear. The legislation is a landmark step towards ending marine litter within the EU. Moreover, the EU is a strong advocate of an international agreement on plastics and is working towards establishing a Committee for a global agreement at the UN Environment Assembly in February this year. This is the only effective, long-term response to the global problem of marine litter. The EU is also actively raising public awareness, thus building momentum for action against marine litter. Together with the UN and a number of civil society organisations, the EU organises #EUBeachCleanup – a global ocean-activism campaign, which every year mobilises tens of thousands of volunteers in removing litter from beaches and inland waterways.

Achieving carbon neutrality also means a transition towards zero-emission maritime transport. The sector is the backbone of global trade and supply chains, but it still relies almost entirely on carbon-intensive fuels. The Fuel-EU Maritime Proposal introduces a fuel standard limiting their greenhouse gas intensity, and the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation aims at providing adequate energy infrastructure at ports, in support of the obligation to connect to onshore power supply or use zero-emission technologies while at berth. The extension of the EU Emission Trading System (ETS) to the maritime sector will put emissions from shipping under the general cap and create a price signal to further drive decarbonisation. The EU ambition does not stop at the borders of the Union as it is leading negotiations at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) with a view to finding agreement on the target of zero-emission shipping by 2050. Greening of maritime transport is also a priority in EU funding programmes, such as the € 1.5 billion already invested from the Connecting Europe Facility, and Horizon Europe, through i.a. the Waterborne Partnership (more than € 500 million).

The EU is also putting science and technology at the heart of ocean preservation. “Missions” are a new EU approach to tackle major societal challenges, providing a critical mass of resources for focused research. The Mission “Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030” aims to ensure that the ocean plays a central role in meeting the 2030 targets of the European Green Deal. It will support big innovation projects – “lighthouses” – aimed at developing and testing solutions in support of protecting 30% of the EU’s sea area, restoring marine and waterway ecosystems, reducing plastic litter at sea, nutrient losses and use of chemical pesticides by 50%, and making the blue economy climate-neutral and circular.

Launched by President von der Leyen during the One Ocean Summit, a digital ocean platform – the European Digital Twin Ocean – will be developed under this Mission and will place the EU as a digital champion for the ocean. Based on observations, models and the latest technological advances, the Digital Twin Ocean is a computing environment, which will allow the assessment of different scenarios, advancing the understanding of the marine environment and providing knowledge-based input to decision-making. The Digital Twin Ocean will ensure open and unrestricted access to marine data, cover knowledge gaps and foster integration of existing forecasting and modelling applications at EU level.

The research on oceans does not end there. We also need ocean literacy which will support the development of wider awareness and knowledge and create opportunities to put new knowledge into practice. The EU is working to enhance ocean literacy by education and investing in research, and the EU4Ocean coalition is one such example. This bottom-up inclusive initiative brings together different partners to share knowledge and improve oceans literacy and the sustainable management of the ocean.

There would also be support for the fishing industry, and the council would join other local authorities in calling on the government to take action including the appointment of a dedicated minister for coastal communities.

Preventing plastic pollution into the sea would also be part of the campaign.

Blackpool Council is set to join a campaign to protect our oceans

The council’s tourism, economy and communities scrutiny committee is being asked to agree that a motion is put to full council to “declare an urgent need for ocean recovery.”

Dubbed a Motion for the Ocean it has been developed “to help local authorities play their part in realising a clean, healthy and productiveocean and all of the direct economic, health and wellbeing benefits it will bring”, according to a report to the committee.

If Blackpool agrees to the motion, it will be joining other councils including Plymouth, Falmouth, South Tyneside, North Norfolk, North Devon and Monmouthshire in taking steps to protect coastal waters.

The campaign also includes councils putting pressure on the government to strengthen regulations around single-use plastics.

A further aim is to call on ministers to set standards for microfibre-catching filters to ensure all new washing machines are fitted with a filter that captures a high percentage of microfibres produced in the wash cycle.

The report adds: “Our ocean and climate are in a state of emergency, the communities we serve are vulnerable to these emergencies, and local government has an essential and urgent part to play in tackling these interconnected crises.

“As a local authority we have already declared a climate emergency. The ocean is included in our climate action plans, but needs its own working group to ensure we address specific issues and protect our ocean.”",en,"Blackpool, Monmouthshire, Plymouth, North Devon, North Norfolk, South Tyneside, Falmouth",Blackpool Council,,"ocean, campaign, council, local, blackpool, government, communities, motion, climate, authorities"

These features include the subtidal sandbanks, reefs, sea caves and Grey seal population. By protecting these features, the habitats and species that are found there are monitored and safeguarded for the future.

As Lundy’s waters had been protected for some time, it was appropriate to place the UK’s first No Take Zone along its east coast. An area of 3.3.km2 is covered by the fisheries byelaw and within this area nothing (particularly plants and animals) can be taken, or added, up to the high water mark along the shoreline.

In 2010, Lundy’s Marine Nature Reserve became the UK’s first Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ), specifically for the protection of the Spiny lobster, Palinuras elephas, also known as a Crawfish, which is very rare. Under this protection, these lobsters cannot be fished and are protected by Devon and Severn IFCA byelaws as part of the MCZ designation.

LUNDY’S CODE OF CONDUCT

Lundy's Zoning Scheme and No Take Zone apply to everyone. These are strictly enforced and much of the Code of Conduct is underpinned by law. The code is for everyone who visits Lundy to ensure that the marine life is protected for future generations.

According to reports, BP has sought approval to dump 14 pipes and control cables onto a marine protection area (MPA), 120 miles west of Shetland, and then eventually drop all BP’s floating ship’s steel mooring lines and anchors on the same site, totaling 4,180 tons.

The MPA designation was because of the gravel ecosystem, rare giant deep-sea sponges, and ocean quahog, a very slow-growing mollusk,” known to live up to 500 years in the area.

BP claimed dumping the cables would not affect the seabed and would still allow recovery of the pipes.

“Our plans to recover and dispose of the Foinaven risers and our commitments to minimize the impact on the environment as part of our decommissioning process remain unchanged,” BP said.

However, reports said that BP’s riser cables weighing almost 2,400 tons would cost tens of millions to retrieve and need special retrieval ships and underwater vessels.

“Since the regulator has given permission for the risers simply to be dropped, with the potential for far greater impact on the seabed and making future recovery far less likely, this could set a precedent for other oil and gas companies to do the same,” Greenpeace UK Chief Scientist Dr. Doug Parr said.",en,UK,"BP, British Petroleum",Doug Parr,"bp, cables, marine, area, tons, pipes, british, petroleum, waste, sea"

Negotiations at U.N. headquarters in New York were suspended early Saturday following two weeks of talks that environmentalists had hoped would close a gap in international marine protection measures.

A proposed treaty would set rules for protecting biodiversity in two-thirds of the world’s ocean areas that are outside of national jurisdictions.

Less than 1% of the high seas are protected without a new treaty, and “pockets of marine protection are not enough” for threatened species, said Maxine Burkett, the United States deputy assistant secretary of state who was involved in negotiations.

The global goal is to set aside 30% of ocean area as some kind of marine sanctuary.

Ocean health also us key to combatting climate change because more than 90% of the excess heat from climate change is absorbed by the seas. Marine heat waves are getting longer and more frequent.

WATCH: Climate change is worsening heat waves in oceans. Here’s why that’s a problem

“The ocean cannot afford further delay,” Burkett said earlier in the week, when the negotiations looked promising.

In the Caribbean, “our livelihoods are directly dependent on the health of the ocean,” said Janine Felson, Belize’s ambassador to the United Nations.

Talks centered on how to share benefits from marine life, establish protected areas, prevent harm from human activity on the high seas and to help poor countries gain the skills and means for ocean exploration.

Campaigners expressed disappointment at the failure to reach a deal but said the talks produced some progress.

Laura Meller, who leads Greenpeace’s ocean protection campaign, accused rich countries such as the United States of being too slow to compromise.

“Russia has also been a key blocker in negotiations, refusing to engage in the treaty process itself, or attempting to compromise with the European Union and many other states on a wide range of issues,” Meller said.

The talks will resume next year unless a special emergency session is called before the end of 2022.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Monica Medina also voiced disappointment but expressed hope that the work done so far would carry forward. She said the United States remained committed to the goal of protecting at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030.

“We cannot let the tides and currents push us back. We must keep going,” Medina said.",en,"U.S., the United States, Russia, New York, United States, Belize","United Nations, Greenpeace, State, UNITED NATIONS, the United Nations, the European Union, U.N., UN","Maxine Burkett, Monica Medina, Laura Meller, Janine Felson","marine, ocean, united, treaty, talks, nations, protection, seas, negotiations, states"

These concerns were expressed in 2021 at an MPA Compliance Forum, in which community members expressed their concerns over the deteriorating health of Big River State Marine Conservation Area (SMCA) and Mendocino’s other MPAs.

To address these concerns, the Mendocino MPA Collaborative, one of fourteen county-based collaboratives within the MPA Collaborative Network, in partnership with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and State Parks, recently launched a new pilot project to encourage compliance with Marine Protected Area (MPA) regulations. This includes the implementation of a digital sign at Big River SMCA, an MPA in the heart of Mendocino County that protects its unique and robust biological diversity. The digital sign flashes a series of messages to visitors, informing them that they are in an MPA and should stay back from wildlife, watch for swimmers, and leash dogs. The effectiveness of the flashing sign will be evaluated through visitor surveys. If deemed successful, similar projects could be implemented at MPAs across the state.

Stop by Ford House Visitor Center and Museum in Mendocino (open 11-4 pm every day) to participate in a survey for this project to better understand how the sign impacts behavior in Marine Protected Areas. The digital sign will be up from April to July with notifications about MPAs and appropriate activities that can take place in MPAs.

This pilot project is part of a larger effort to increase awareness of MPAs and compliance with MPA regulations throughout the state. The Mendocino MPA Collaborative, and the MPA Collaborative Network it is a part of, brings together diverse community members, agencies, and organizations to create more effective coastal resource management along the Mendocino coastline. The Mendocino Collaborative is led by representatives of The Nature Conservancy and Noyo Harbor District. Partners include the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Sonoma MPA Collaborative, and California State Parks. The project is made possible through funding from the Ocean Protection Council and Resources Legacy Fund.

518,2022-06-08,There will be no climate change mitigation without ocean protection - International Science Council,https://council.science/current/blog/no-climate-change-mitigation-without-ocean-protection/,36,33,3,0,council.science,United States,"Climate change is the most pressing long-term global challenge we face today. It threatens our health, security, economic stability, and our quality of life. As human activity continues to heat up the Earth’s atmosphere, we are releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the air. These pollutants trap solar energy in the atmosphere, raising temperatures on Earth at a rate of about 1.7 degrees Celsius per century since 1970. This affects all aspects of human existence, from communities that live near coastal zones to food production systems around the world.

On World Ocean Day 2022, and as part of the United Nations Ocean Decade, we should reflect on the state of the ocean and what we can do to address the increasing challenges facing the ocean. The ocean is a huge resource for humanity and the planet as a whole. It provides food, water and other resources essential for human existence and the environment. Indeed, more than three billion people rely on the ocean for their livelihoods. And the ocean is also an integral part of the climate system. Oceanographers and climate scientists are working tirelessly to understand the effects of climate change on the ocean and the environment.

Martin Visbeck, ISC Board Member and head of the Physical Oceanography research unit at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, reminds us that “World Ocean Day provides a unique opportunity for the marine community to raise awareness about how the ocean is connected to people.”, but also that the day “reminds us that we only have one globally connected ocean, that is directly linked to our planet’s climate and provides opportunities for sustainable use and protection to safeguard our common future.”

As the Earth’s temperature rises, glaciers and ice sheets are melting. The rise in sea level is happening all over the world, and it’s cumulative – the ocean is rising faster now than it did 100 or 1000 years ago. By the end of this century, the sea level could be about three feet higher than it is now, according to the IPCC’s Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere. The areas of the world that are most vulnerable to these impacts are low-lying coastal areas and island nations. With increasing global surface temperatures, the likelihood of droughts and increasingly intense storms is higher. As more water vapour is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes fuel for more powerful storms to develop. Storms cause more damage to coastal communities, amounting to billions of dollars in losses each year. Taken together, climate change, acidification and sea level rise are affecting the ocean in multiple ways, and all are having an impact on the global climate.

“The ocean is strongly linked to the climate system, it stores and transports large amounts of heat, moderates the regional and global climate but also is directly affected by climate change with ubiquitous warming, rising sea levels, loss of dissolved oxygen and rapidly increasing oceanic heat waves, stressing the ocean’s ecosystem often beyond recovery.” – Martin Visbeck, ISC Board Member and head of the Physical Oceanography research unit at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research

Furthermore, as the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), it becomes more acidic. The ocean is a crucial factor in the global carbon cycle, and over time it can have a significant impact on climate. When CO 2 enters the ocean, it forms carbonic acid, which negatively affects marine ecosystems and animal populations. Acidification also makes it more difficult for marine plants and animals to create their own shells and skeletons.

There are several ways that humanity can help to prevent or mitigate damage from climate change to the ocean. We can reduce our own emissions, help to protect and restore vital coral reefs, and develop better water management practices. When science teaches us that ocean habitats (seagrasses, salt marshes, mangroves, etc.) can sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at rates up to four times higher than terrestrial forests, we need to consider the ocean as a pillar of climate change mitigation.

Martin Visbeck confirms that “the ocean and its related maritime economy provide opportunities to mitigate climate change by producing CO 2 -free energy by wind, currents and its vertical thermal gradient. It can absorb and store CO 2 from the atmosphere and contribute to the desired reduction of CO 2 in the atmosphere. Ocean industries can reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants by modern ship propulsion systems based on low CO 2 fuels or electric propulsion.”

In their attempts to mitigate climate change, decision-makers must consider the state of the ocean an indispensable factor. Nonetheless, as pointed out by Visbeck and many other oceanographers and climate scientists worldwide, “all of this requires global cooperation, awareness, knowledge, and action. Together we can imagine a prosperous future for the ocean, climate, and people.”

As more knowledge bubbles to the surface about our biosphere’s saltwater stretches, so too are their imperative roles in oxygen provision, carbon capture, biodiversity preservation, food and livelihoods.

But without adequate protection, seascapes can quickly transform into ‘blue deserts’, bereft of life and unable to perform the critical ecosystem functions upon which all of our lives depend. Climate change, unsustainable development, pollution and overfishing all pose significant challenges. Meanwhile, recent global agreements and negotiations on managing the high seas, protecting biodiversity, and evaluating the risks and rewards of seabed mining have so far fallen short of their stated ambitions.

With that urgent backdrop, delegates from across the globe gathered on 13–14 April for the seventh Our Ocean conference. The in-person element of the event took place in Palau, marking the first time for it to be hosted by a small island developing state. At the conference, 410 commitments were made to scale up ocean protection in a range of areas, at an estimated value of USD 16.35 billion.

Will that be enough to set the global community on a sustainable trajectory as it gears up for the UN Ocean Conference in June, and the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) later this year? Via email, Landscape News spoke with attendee and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Pacific Director Mark Drew to hear his perspective on the what the conference means for our oceans.

What were your main hopes for the Our Ocean conference? To what extent were these hopes realized?

The seventh Our Ocean was a global stage for Pacific leadership on ocean protection and building a sustainable blue economy. It’s also the first in the Our Ocean series to be held in a small island developing state. Pacific nations are at the epicenter of the fight for healthy and prosperous oceans, and that was on display in Palau last week. They are demonstrating exceptional leadership, and it’s incumbent on the world to redouble efforts and investment in ecosystem health, sustainable blue foods, and healthy oceans that work for people and the planet.

Our Ocean successfully brought together representatives from over 80 countries to step up, commit and advance an oceans agenda and sustainable future with important recognition of small island developing states. We need to build on the momentum and continue to change the relationship that humanity has with nature and to respect the limits the oceans have supporting communities, economies and the well-being of our planet.

What key challenges remain?

Our Ocean saw new commitments and momentum in the right direction; now it’s time to accelerate investment and implementation. Time is not on our side, and incremental changes are not going to deliver the results people and the planet need. We need to urgently:

1) Invest in marine nature-based solutions. Ecosystems such as mangroves, kelp forests and seagrass meadows are incredibly effective carbon sinks, as are marine species like whales, sharks and tunas. Protecting and restoring ecosystems and wildlife is a triple-bottom-line win for the ocean, climate and people.

2) Protect 30 percent of the ocean by 2030. A global treaty for the high seas is an essential prerequisite for achieving this target, which has broad global support.

3) Invest in institutions and capacity building within small island developing states (SIDS).

4) Advocate for a blue foods agenda whereby foods produced and sourced by the ocean are recognized as being integral to Pacific Islanders’ food security.

5) Realize a moratorium on deep sea mining.

6) Improve seafood tracing and law enforcement to eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). IUU fishing is associated with human rights abuses and other criminal networks. It should have no place in our markets.

7) Agree on an ambitious, legally binding treaty to tackle plastic pollution by 2024.

8) Responsibly scale-up offshore renewable energy. The ocean and climate crises cannot be separated. Replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy is a must-do.

How should the conference outcomes feed into the upcoming UN Ocean conference and COP27?

Our Ocean demonstrated that there is global agreement about the centrality of the ocean to human well-being and climate mitigation and adaptation. The UN Ocean Conference must build on this momentum to deliver on its theme of scaling up ocean action. While additional commitments are needed, particularly in terms of financing and effective, inclusive protected areas, we must move to implementing programmes that bring tangible improvements in ocean health.

Each successive UNFCCC COP has shown greater integration of the ocean in the climate discussion – a hopeful sign, as we know we cannot solve one crisis without effectively addressing the other. An annual ocean-climate dialogue is now integrated into the UNFCCC process, which further supports integration of ocean and climate targets and solutions. We must seize the opportunity to further oceans as being central to addressing the impacts of climate change.

Any final comments?

We have an opportunity and we have an imperative. The science is clear.

By Mark Gold, D.Env.

By now, everyone in the nation, if not globally has heard about California’s groundbreaking new circular economy and plastic pollution reduction law: SB 54. Senator Ben Allen, an OPC council member, authored the bill and received tremendous support from the Newsom administration, leadership in the legislature, the environmental community, manufacturers, and waste managers: an extraordinary and unprecedented coalition. Governor Newsom, always ready to seize the day, put California into the global environmental limelight with a stroke of a pen on the same day as the Supreme Court condemned millions of people to devastating public health threats through a court ruling that prevents the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from taking broad greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction action on power plants. California’s move to an extended producer responsibility and circular economy approach to plastic pollution reduction builds on the state’s marine debris leadership through plastic bag bans, the ocean litter prevention strategy (PDF) developed by OPC and NOAA, and the world’s first comprehensive microplastics strategy (PDF).

California’s leadership on plastic pollution and climate is juxtaposed with the commitments, pronouncements, and rhetoric at the UN Oceans Conference in Lisbon. The chorus of “1.5 (degrees Celsius of temperature increase) to stay alive” was heard at every event as was the inextricable linkage between climate change and ocean health. Also, numerous sessions have focused on plastic pollution and marine debris and the recent UN Environment Assembly commitment to end plastic pollution and develop a legally binding international instrument by the end of 2024. The comprehensive approach will include components such as promoting a circular economy (an enormous focus of SB 54), microplastics, monitoring and reporting, an array of actions, and reducing the substantial GHG emissions from plastics manufacturing.

Although most of the sessions focused on the scope and scale of the global plastic pollution crisis and its disproportionate impact on developing nations, some of the plastic alternative technology companies pitched their wares as a potential panacea to the crisis. We were even given a free plastic water bottle in the conference canvas bags that were generously given to participants. Many attendees were shocked about the additional plastic provided. I bring all of this up because single or even multiple-use plastic items made from kelp, soy, corn, or other natural sources still pose tremendous ecological risks to aquatic life when they get into our rivers, lakes, and oceans.

Overall though there was a great deal of excitement about the imminent initiation of negotiations on the UN Environmental Assembly’s End Plastic Pollution: Towards an Internationally Legally Binding Instrument (PDF). Also, members of the scientific community were enthusiastic about our growing capabilities to detect smaller and smaller microplastics more quickly and more affordably. And of course, the environmental NGO community, as well as tribal nations, talked about numerous individual local and regional plastic pollution problems and success stories – many of them personal and heartfelt. With all of this discussion half a world away this week, Governor Newsom’s action to sign SB 54 could not have come at a better time.

Here are observations from some of California’s ocean conservation leaders that have played a prominent role in Lisbon this week. Marce Guttierez-Graudins is the founder and Executive Director of Azul: a powerful voice for environmental justice and marine conservation. Chad Nelsen is the CEO of Surfrider Foundation: a global environmental group headquartered in San Clemente that conserves surf breaks, beaches, and marine life. Margaret Spring is the Chief Conservation and Science Officer at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. All three of them are long-time prominent leaders in efforts to stop plastic pollution in California and beyond.

Marce Guttierez-Graudins

From California to the UN Oceans Conference in Portugal, it is exciting to see a new focus on environmental justice and equity in ocean conservation. Based on our report “Neglected: Environmental Justice Impacts of Plastic Pollution” published in 2021 by the United Nations Environmental Program, we understand that plastic pollution has a disproportionate impact on already vulnerable populations around the world, so I am heartened by the success of California’s SB54 – with the leadership of Senator Ben Allen and Asm. Luz Rivas – which puts our state at the forefront of efforts to curb plastic pollution. There is still work to do in order to achieve a global plastic treaty – but today California has put forth an excellent precedent to inspire us in this effort.

Chad Nelsen

From the perspective of the Surfrider Foundation, a grassroots advocacy organization from the United States, it’s always interesting to see what is happening at the UN level and in Europe, where they are ahead of us (the United States) on some important environmental issues like climate action.

On one hand, it’s inspiring to see so many people here focused on large-scale solutions for marine protection, rewilding the sea and blue carbon, serious financial commitments from state actors, and NGO’s seeking accountability on issues like deep sea mining. On the other hand, voluntary global treaties and broad frameworks on issues such as plastic may not drive the tough decisions that must be made to reduce serious ocean pollution and redesign how society interacts with and perceives waste.

SB 54 in California presents a case study with global ramifications in the practical challenges of creating serious change to reduce all single-use plastics.

Margaret Spring

Based on our science and advocacy at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and my role as Chair of the National Academies (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine) panel and our report, “Reckoning with the US Role in Global Ocean Plastic Waste,” I arrived at the UN Conference with a clear eye on what needs to be done, and who needs to be involved. Solutions are complex and it will require serious commitment, follow-through action, and cooperation at all levels. Here in Lisbon, the energy and desire for meaningful action is strong, but the specifics are still evolving – with UNEP providing a beginning framework and information for policymakers. The pending global treaty is adding urgency to the timeline, and there is much to be done, including developing a US strategy on plastic pollution. California has always been a step ahead – even before SB 54 – and we’ve now shown how to take urgency to action, and we will continue to do more. I’ll leave here knowing California leads the US and is contributing to global solutions to the plastic pollution crisis.",en,"San Clemente, California, the United States, Portugal, Lisbon, US, D.Env","the UN Environmental Assembly’s End Plastic Pollution: Towards an Internationally Legally Binding Instrument, the Surfrider Foundation, NOAA, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, UN Environment Assembly, NGO, OPC, Azul, Surfrider Foundation, the UN Oceans Conference, the Supreme Court, UNEP, California Ocean Protection Council, National Academies, the United Nations Environmental Program, the UN Conference, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, UN","Ben Allen, Mark Gold, Marce Guttierez-graudins, Luz Rivas, Chad Nelsen, Margaret Spring","plastic, pollution, california, environmental, global, ocean, action, un, sb, marine"

Plastic pollution is a persistent and growing problem worldwide that significantly impacts the health of our oceans and beaches. Roughly 8 million metric tons of plastics are estimated to enter the ocean each year, and the United States is one of the top 20 contributors to plastic pollution. Plastic has been found in a wide range of marine environments including the seafloor, surface water, the water column, and on beaches and shorelines. California communities are estimated to spend more than $428 million annually to clean up and control plastic pollution. Plastic never truly degrades into its chemical components; instead it physically breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces. Plastics under 5 millimeters in size are called microplastics, and are found worldwide, even in places considered pristine. Plastics have been found in the digestive tracts of marine organisms ranging from zooplankton to whales, and microplastics have been found in drinking water and food, including shellfish, salt, beer, and honey.

The State of California has become a leader in preventing ocean litter by passing a ban on single-use plastic bags, and by banning microplastics in wash-off products, like face scrubs and toothpaste. The OPC’s marine pollution program works to address ocean litter by coordinating among the wide range of state agencies and nongovermental organizations that work on plastic pollution, and by supporting needed research to help the state better respond to microplastic pollution.

Funding

Featured Initiatives and Projects

Developing Scientific Trash Monitoring

Starting in 2017, OPC developed a series of projects with the State Water Resources Control Board to develop, validate, and standardize trash monitoring methodologies. These projects also worked to educate interested organizations about scientific trash monitoring methodologies.

Unpackaging Alameda

In 2016, OPC funded a pilot project to “unpackage” Alameda. Through this project, Clean Water Fund worked with 80 to 100 businesses in Alameda to reduce their reliance on single-use disposable food packaging. This project piloted changes in institutional purchasing to reduce the prevalence of single-use foodware that typically becomes plastic pollution. Overall the 80 businesses that participated are estimated to eliminate over 6 million pieces of single-use foodware annually, preventing over 64 thousand pounds of waste each year. Collectively these businesses are estimated to save over $139,000 annually.

Newport Bay Water Wheel

In 2018, OPC approved a $1.68 million Proposition 1 grant to the City of Newport Beach for planning and construction of the Newport Bay Water Wheel Project. This project is modeled closely on the design of the successful Baltimore Trash Wheel project. The Newport Bay Water Wheel could immediately reduce trash load reductions of 50%-80% once installed.

Interactions between microplastics and pathogen pollutants

In 2018, OPC approved a grant to UC Davis for research to investigate microplastics as a potential vector for terrestrial pathogens in the marine environment. This project will investigate the interaction between microplastics and land-based protozoan parasites such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Toxoplasma, and whether these parasites can ‘hitchike’ on microplastics to infect commercial shellfish species.",en,"California, Newport Bay, the City of Newport Beach, the United States, The State of California, Alameda","the Newport Bay Water Wheel Project, Baltimore Trash Wheel, UC Davis, OPC, California Ocean Protection Council, Clean Water Fund, the State Water Resources Control Board",Michaela Miller,"plastic, pollution, water, microplastics, project, opc, trash, ocean, marine, state"
536,2022-06-28,Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation creates their own Marine Protected Area in Great Bear Rainforest - Haida Gwaii Observer,https://www.haidagwaiiobserver.com/news/kitasoo-xaixais-nation-creates-their-own-marine-protected-area-in-great-bear-rainforest/,3,3,0,0,haidagwaiiobserver.com,United States,"After decades of talks with governments they couldn’t wait any longer

A new Marine Protected Area (MPA) has been independently declared in the Great Bear Rainforest the Kitasoo Xai’xais Stewardship Authority announced on June 22.

“For decades we have worked with Canada and British Columbia to collaboratively form an MPA in Kitasu Bay (Gitdisdzu Lugyeks). We will continue to encourage that outcome, but can no longer wait until other governments act to preserve and protect this special place that is integral to our Nation,” Doug Neasloss, elected chief of the Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation said.

“Our right to establish this MPA comes from our inherent and Aboriginal Rights and Title and from our connection to this land for thousands of years.”

For the next three months, the Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation will be accepting public input on a draft management plan for the MPA.

They will also be sharing the plan with other stakeholders and governments. They would like to work with Canada and British Columbia to reach common objectives, Neasloss said. However, he clarified, they are not asking for permission.

“We note that the prime minister personally travelled to the Great Bear Coast in 2018 to sign the Reconciliation Framework Agreement, which included a commitment to establishing a network of Marine Protected Areas. The prime minister spoke about his commitment to marine conservation and the MPA network, and we trust he will support this step forward,” Neasloss said.

Jennifer Rice, North Coast MLA, had a previous career in marine-use planning. She understands that the Kitasoo Xai’xais are frustrated with how slow the process has been, she stated a June 24 email.

“I have been to Kitasu Bay with Chief Neasloss and have seen the tremendous abundance and sustenance it provides for people. Our government respects and acknowledges the efforts of First Nations to help protect ecosystems within their territories, through their declaration of Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas,” she stated.

“I am confident that the Kitasoo/Xai’xais and other coastal First Nations have a partner in our provincial government in rectifying this, particularly in regards to reconciliation and stewardship of B.C. land and waters.”

Kitasu Bay is a spiritual place for the First Nation, most of whom live in Klemtu, less than 20 kilometres away.

The 33.5 square kilometre area of ocean now under protection is home to seabirds, whales, salmon, cod, halibut, shellfish and vital kelp forests. The wildlife along with the lands and waters are important to the nation’s economy, health and culture.

Kitasoo Xai’xais Nation drafted a management plan that uses a science-based, Indigenous-led approach to conservation.

Guardian Watchmen will be part of monitoring, patrolling for poaching and conducting marine rescues.

Fisheries officers are sparse in remote regions such as Kitasu Bay which is why the Kitasoo Xai’xais Guardian Watchmen, who are already on the water every day, will be used to help manage the MPA.

“We know these lands and waters better than anyone, Kitasu Bay has been part of our home for thousands of years through to the present day. This coast is our lifeblood,” Hereditary Chief Nies’los (Kelly Robinson) said.
