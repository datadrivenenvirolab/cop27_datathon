# Introduction

The main goal of the prompt is to be able to address the big question of “How can analysis and visualization of publicly available data be used to further map the ambition of current net-zero CO2eq or GHG non-state actor targets/commitments?”  

In this slide deck, we will be detailing our approaches on the prompt, using the Net Zero tracker dataset as the baseline.  

This submission includes a Tableau Public and Power BI files that will detail the visualization and analysis that we would like to present.
