# Introduction
The Paris Climate Agreement included guidelines to “take stock” of the world’s progress towards the climate goals set forth by the Agreement (Page 20, Article 14). The agreement states that the first global stocktake (GST) will be in 2023. The GST gave way to the COP27 Global Stocktake Climate Datathon, which launched on September 21st, and closes on October 15th.

Organized by the Open Earth Foundation, Data-Driven Enviro Lab 2.0, and Climate Action Data 2.0, the datathon fosters innovation, collaboration, and the creation of data visualization tools to aid in the analysis of climate data for the 2023 GST. With the opportunity provided by the event, a small, global team of passionate climate activists is working to tackle the prompt to “Map the Climate Data Platform Space.” This work in progress is the result of that collaborative effort.
